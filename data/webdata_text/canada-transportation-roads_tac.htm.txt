transportation association of canada - about tac background tac’s origins date back to 1914, when the canadian good roads association was founded. cgra was mainly concerned with the establishment of a superior national road network and was one of the main forces behind construction of the trans-canada highway. during the 1950s, cgra became more involved with specialized technical activities and by the 1960s, its role had broadened, resulting in a name change to the roads and transportation association of canada (rtac) in 1970. throughout the 1970s and 1980s, rtac continued to expand its mandate to include all modes of transport for passengers and freight, and, in 1990, the name of the organization was changed to reflect the increased scope of activities.the transportation association of canada now has a multi-modal, multi-disciplinary emphasis, in addition to its traditional roadway transport interests. members include federal, provincial and municipal transportation departments; other government departments; shippers and freight carriers; passenger carriers; contractors and road-builders; consultants and academic and research interests. this broad membership base and tac’s cooperative approach make the association distinct from other transportation organizations. about tac | programs | resources | events | what's new | home copyright © 1998 transportation association of canada, all rights reserved.
