no. with somewhere between 500,000 and 750,000 black bears in north america, and at least 350,000,000 humans, fatal black bear attacks are still one of the rarest events in nature. in recorded history, there have only been a total of 43 fatal black bear attacks in all of north america. in the great smoky mountains np alone, we get 10 million people a year coming through an 800 square mile area with a black bear population of over 1,800 animals. feeding bears food from their hands, chasing cubs through the woods with video cameras, mobs surrounding trees a family of bears has taken refuge in, restaurants baiting bears for the viewing pleasure of their guests ... these are just some examples of ridiculous behavior that takes place every year with surprisingly little cost in human lives. do we need to change our behavior towards black bears? no. black bears demand respect, but not fear from backcountry users. while in the backcountry we are visiting their home. taking proper precautions with food, enjoying sightings of these animals from a respectful distance, leaving bear cubs alone, these things will continue to provide safe enjoyable backcountry experiences for millions of users. please do not take firearms into the great smoky mountains np. it is against the law, and you will be bringing in a real danger to battle imaginary ones. if you are too concerned to feel safe in the park without a gun, you probably do not need to be there. the ongoing rumors concerning foul play stem from three sources: 1. the fact that a fatal black bear attack had never before occurred in the southeast. 2. the fact that the woman was out with her ex-husband (in the process of reconciling). 3. the long time interval between initial contact and contacting the park service. these rumors will persist for at least a couple more months; on friday the coroner announced he will not release any preliminary findings from the victim's autopsy until the final report is completed 2 to 3 months from now. a committee of park service employees, the trackers, and bear experts from around the country will study the results from the woman's autopsy, the bear's necropsy, and the tracker's report to produce a final report on the incident later this year. ********* ***** ** gary coulbourne *************************.* bear hacktivist ****** *********** ** *******o 02.50 ===#> r ******* ********* **** ****`- systems administrator ******* ********* ***** http://www.bears.org ****** ********** **** bear@bears.org ## ***** ***** ## **** animal conservation/preservation ### ***** ### **** #,,, ***,,, ##,,, **,,, previous message: [bearfolks] re: [hsi-animalia] bears protection next message: [bearfolks] what kind of sound does an american blck bear make messages sorted by: [ date ] [ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ]
