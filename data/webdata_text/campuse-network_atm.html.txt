uwng and atm on the matter of atm 1998-11-16 the evolution of ethernet that started with the emergence of the ethernet switch has eliminated atm as a required campus transmission-system strategy. in 1997, there was no reason to believe that we would be replacing uw's telephone system with some form of atm-distributed phone system ... and now, major phone-system vendors (eg, nortel) are looking to ip over gigabit ethernet as the vehicle for the interconnection of their future distributed-component telephony technologies. there is no reason to believe that we will need to provision for native "broadcast-quality video" throughout the campus. most of the opportunity that exists is for videoconferencing traffic for distance-ed applications, and that will be addressed by emerging ip-based "multicast" application software. for the moment, however, atm is still required for the connection of the campus network to the onet network, although that will likely be replaced by an ip/wdm base in a few years. atm is also still used as a backbone transmission system within the faculty of mathematics. maintained by rwwatt@uwaterloo.ca
