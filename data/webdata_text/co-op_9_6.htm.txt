9.6 audience 9.6 audience the way in which you write a report depends on your audience. for example, a report directed at the vice-president of an organization is written differently from a report directed at a co-worker in a specialized field. your report may be widely circulated: your fellow employees and supervisors, as well as your field co-ordinator and faculty members, may read it. as you write the report, focus on one type of reader only. state for whom the report is written. if the report is being written at the request of your supervisor, mention this in your letter of submittal and in the introduction. if your report contains specialized terminology and you are writing for a technically trained audience, your terms do not need further explanation. if you are writing for a large audience that is only slightly familiar with your work, you need to explain your terminology more carefully.
