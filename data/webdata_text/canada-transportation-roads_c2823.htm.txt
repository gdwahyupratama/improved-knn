"i believe that the provincial auditor serves a valuable role for the province of ontario and for the taxpayers," clark said. "as of this moment, more than 70 per cent of all the recommendations the auditor made to my ministry have been completed, and we will move very quickly on the rest." disponible en français for more information visit www.mto.gov.on.ca -30- for further information: geoff bell, minister's office, tel.: (416) 327-1824, fax: (416) 327-9188; bob nichols, communications branch, tel.: (416) 327-1158, fax: (416) 327-2200 to view other releases from this ministry, search news releases today | organization | date | keyword
