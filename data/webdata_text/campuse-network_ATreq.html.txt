appletalk requests and registrations appletalk requests and registrations 2001-12-18 a request for the assignment of an appletalk zone is to be mailed to hostmaster. a request submitted by any person other than the cnag representative responsible for the requestor's constituency will be forwarded to the cnag representative for confirmation before being processed further. no device that uses the appletalk zone may be connected to the network until the appletalk zone been assigned and registered. appletalk zone-number assignments are derived from ip subnet number within which the appletalk devices using the requested zone will exist. to provide a reasonable number of appletalk zone numbers for each ip subnet, the range of permitted zone numbers is a subset of the ip subnet number times 100. for ip subnet number xxx (129.97.xxx), the range of permitted zone numbers is from xxx00 to xxx19. the appletalk zone numbers for tunnels defined in this ip subnet would also be assigned from this range of zone numbers. roger watt, ist.
