health services - university of waterloo health services influenza immunizations health services is housed in the health services building overlying the pond and across from the student life centre. the primary mandate of health services is to be the on-site family physician for all registered full and part-time, graduate and under-graduate students. outreach activities for the entire university community include other important functions such as health care for visiting students and faculty, and urgent care and first aid to university of waterloo employees and visitors. health services is different than a doctor's office off-campus. at health services we understand that students, in unfamiliar surroundings and without the immediate help of family, require a degree of care which is generally not possible in community health care settings. therefore we have developed student support services to respond to the special health concerns and needs of university students. we believe that these services make a positive contribution to the quality of student life on campus. health services aims to promote a healthy learning community within which individually healthy students can achieve academic goals and establish patterns for future healthy living. drop in: appointments are often available on the same day. call 888-4096 or drop in to get the first available appointment. last update november 29, 2001 this page maintained by chris strome. copyright © university of waterloo
