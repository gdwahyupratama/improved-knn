10.4 the co-op fee 10.4 the co-op fee: how it is set and spent this section was prepared by the office of institutional analysis & planning (iap) and cecs. the co-op program at uw offers students opportunities to obtain relevant work experience while working toward the degree of their choice. a co-op program is more expensive than traditional university education, since it requires year-round facilities, full-time teaching resources, and year-round support for administration. since its inception in 1957, the university of waterloo has applied an extra charge to its co-op students (the co-op fee) that was initially built into tuition. this fee offsets the additional costs associated with the operation of the university as a co-op institution. the fee is not a job placement fee. since this fee represents a student's second largest fee assessment (next to tuition), all co-op students should be fully informed of how the fee is set and spent. 10.4.1 how is the fee set? the office of institutional analysis and planning (iap) calculates the co-op fee by dividing the total projected allowable expenses by the total projected co-op registrations. the new rate is then presented to the board of governors for approval. each year, iap staff go through a two-step process to set the new fee. first, they review the previous year's co-op work-term expenses and the total fees collected; the difference is carried forward to the next year as a cumulative over (or under) collection. for example, work-term costs in 2000/01 were $6,159,158 (net of a cumulative under-collection for previous years of $393,246). total fees collected were $6,128,800, resulting in an under-collection of $170,000. next, iap estimates the total co-op registrations and allowable expenses for the upcoming year. they take into account new projects and anticipate changes in cecs with the goal of balancing the revenue and expenses over a three or four year period. in 1999, they estimated expenses of $5,558,310 and collections of $5,808,334. the actual expenses for 1999 totalled $5,877,513. the actual fees collected were $6,069,840, resulting in a 1999/2000 over collection of $192,327, to be carried forward for 2000-01. 10.4.2 how is the fee assessed? a co-op degree normally requires 5 or 6 work terms and 8 academic terms. it is important to note that the co-op fees charged are not related to the services received in any one term, but are amortized over the entire program and paid in each of the academic terms. this is done to keep each fee payment as moderate as possible and to minimize administrative costs by collecting co-op fees along with tuition. 10.4.3 what does co-op cost? the cost of a co-op program consists of three parts: work-term administrative related costs academic delivery costs additional costs for year-round operation the following table shows the 2000-2001 costs and their approximate percentage of the total cost: estimated annual cost of operating the uw co-op system 2000/2001 description cost % work term administration related costs $6,159,198 19.2 estimated academic delivery costs $11,100,000 34.5 estimated year-round uw operational costs $14,887,000 46.3 estimated total co-op system costs $32,146,198 100 what the university charges for the additional work-term administrative related resources and services is regulated by the ontario ministry of training, colleges, and universities. the uw co-op fee covers about 22% of the total institutional costs of operating the co-op program. the ontario government has never recognized the extra costs of providing co-op in post-secondary institutions. uw receives no external funding to offset the work-term administrative related co-op costs, academic delivery, or year-round operational costs and is allowed only to recover costs for work-term administrative related expenses. work term administrative related costs 2000/2001 description cost revenue student co-op fee collected $6,128,800 expenses salaries $3,931,951 employee benefits $567,471 supplies and expenses $746,800 equipment and furnishings $12,530 travel expenses $507,891 computing expenses $700,000 space occupancy costs (rent) $85,801 cost recoveries (income) $0 carry forward over/under-collection $393,246 total co-op education department costs $6,159,199 net surplus (deficit) ($170,000) 10.4.4 what is meant by...? § work-term administrative related costs cecs manages the co-op employment process including: recruiting potential employers organizing and scheduling job interviews preparing students for work-terms providing job search training and career counseling providing résumé preparation counseling discussing job options and locations monitoring co-op student work-terms, including job site interviews interacting with the university faculties about mutual student and employer concerns validating that student jobs qualify for co-op degree credit under ministry of training, colleges and universities regulations, the fee can cover the following expenses: salaries and benefits of staff who assist students in obtaining employment travel, telephone, mail, printing, copying, publicity, computing, equipment, furnishings, supplies, and external meetings maintenance costs (utilities, custodial and security services) of space for employees and employers [ figure 1 - work term administrative related costs 2000-01 ] § academic delivery costs additional academic delivery costs arise when the university has to offer extra courses because of the streaming of co-op students. for example, courses are offered twice for students in 1b - in the winter term and again in the spring term  while a non-co-op institution would only have one offering. a study in 1987 determined that the academic delivery costs required for the co-op program were $7.2 million for 1986-87. allowing for inflation, these costs were approximately $9.8 million for the 1998-99 fiscal year. in 1987, the university requested that the ontario government provide additional funding for these extra academic delivery costs. the university still hopes that the government will recognize these extra costs as it has with bilingual universities which must provide two sets of courses  one in english and one in french. § year-round uw operational costs additional costs arise from the year-round operation of various services and facilities in order to support the co-op system. for example, the staff in the registrar's office, the operation of buildings, and the operation of support services such as the library and computing services must be supported during the spring term. year-round costs calculated in the 1987 study amounted to $4.7 million. allowing for inflation, the estimated year-round costs for 1998-99 were $8.2 million. 10.4.6 will the co-op fee go up? the cost of providing a co-op program is significant. until the government recognizes the additional costs associated with co-op programs, there is no chance of government financial support for them. with increasing funding cuts across canada, students will pay for a greater proportion of their education. as with tuition, every effort is made to keep increases as gradual as possible. 10.4.7 work report marking fee the work report marking fee (listed on your student fee statement) is an academic fee separate from the co-op fee. it is based on a formula devised and regulated by the ministry of training, colleges, and universities that considers marking time and the total number of work reports marked. this cost is then divided by the total number of co-op students and a term charge is levied. like the co-op fee, the cost is amortized over the academic terms and students pay the fee on a term-by-term basis, even though they may not submit a work report every term.
