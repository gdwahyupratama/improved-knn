always use proper food storage containers or suspend your food at least four metres off the ground using a park food pole or suspended between two trees. remember that most species of bear are excellent climbers and often find little challenge retrieving a knapsack filled with delectable vittles dangling from a single tree branch. parks canada recommends leaving dogs at home. a barking dog does all the things that are most likely to infuriate a bear and, if it encounters a bear, it might actually run back to you for help  with an angry bear in pursuit! the black bear can certainly outrun a human. if you do encounter a bear... keep a safe distance  about 200 metres  and always leave the bear an escape route. if this means going back and finding another path, do it. don't look aggressive. don't look directly at the animal. turn your body sideways and keep your knees bent  this will make you appear smaller to the bear. if it is snapping its jaws, lowering its head, flattening its ears, growling or making 'wooshing' sounds, it is displaying aggression. try to move slowly away and do nothing to further aggravate the creature. if the bear does not appear aggressive, talk softly and retreat slowly. while bears are very timid creatures, they are also extremely dangerous. if you are attacked... if a bear does charge, remain calm. don't scream, yell or run away from it. this could actually make a bear more aggressive  and on uneven meadow paths, a bear can run twice as fast as you can. know your bear. if you are attacked by a grizzly bear, play dead: curl up into a fetal position and lock your fingers behind your neck. if you are mauled, this will protect you. if you are attacked by a black bear, this won't do much good. parks canada recommends that as a last resort, you should try to intimidate the bear with anything you have at hand. story by:andrew adamson &nbsp home | eastern slope grizzlies | bears of the world | bear facts | bear quiz | survive an attack | bears week episodes on discovery | from the archive &nbsp
