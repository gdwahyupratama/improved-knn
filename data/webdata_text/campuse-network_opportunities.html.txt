uwng problems and opportunities in search of infinite bandwidth at zero cost 1990-02-19 problems the fibre cabling system of the level-one network and the utp cabling systems of the level-three networks are well positioned for high-speed transmission technologies. unfortunately, the coax cabling systems that still exist in all level-two networks and in many level-three networks are functionally obsolete. if everything stays as is, they will continue to have a useful "present" for years to come, but they already have no "future". opportunities the ethernet "multiport repeater" that became a marketplace commodity by 1994 provides "shared ethernet", in which the utp-connected devices contend for the 10mbps aggregate capacity. it has now been obsoleted by the ethernet "switch", in which each port has its own dedicated bandwidth and the ports are internally connected by a multi-bridge bus with aggregate bandwidth sufficient to guarantee concurrent rated-speed connectivity between all pairs of ports. mediumtransmission type dedicatedbandwidth category-5 utpethernet 10mbps fast ethernet100mbps cddi (fddi)100mbps atm25mbps to 155mbps gigabit ethernet (?)1000mbps multimode orsinglemodefibrefddi 100mbps gigabit ethernet1000mbps atm155mbps to 9gbps fast gigabit ethernet10gbps wave division multiplexingnx10gbps a full-duplex ethernet link is possible when there is only a single device at each end of the link. rather than using one direction for traffic and the other direction for collision-detection signaling, it is then possible to send traffic in both directions concurrently. the need for speed the information in the table below has been taken from "networking requirements of audio and motion video", a paper by francois fluckiger of cern, printed in the january 1996 edition of "connexions -- the interoperability report", published by interop company . applicationtechniquebandwidth high-definition tv uncompressed2gbps mpeg-230mbps studio-quality tvmpeg-27mbps broadcast-quality tvmpeg-23mbps vcr-quality tvmpeg-11.4mbps cd-quality audio,per monophonic channel uncompressed728kbps mpeg-audio layer 364kbps video conferencing h.261112kbps gsm32kbps telephone-grade voiceitu g.71164kbps telephone-grade voiceitu g.72132kbps audio portion of video conferencingitu g.728 16kbps telephone-grade voiceus 10164.8kbps voice over the internetus 10152.4kbps the high-bandwidth applications require a "quality of service" (qos) that will be faciliated by ethernet evolution (802.1p enables 8-level priority) and newer ip "service differentiation" mechanisms such as ip tos priority queuing, the resource reservation protocol (rsvp), the real-time transmission protocol (rtp), and ip multicasting. none of this is really "ready for prime time" yet. also, ipv6, the "next generation" version of the ip protocol, will further enhance these mechanisms; it was standardized in 1995, but it could be as much as 20 years before ipv6 becomes "the norm". maintained by rwwatt@uwaterloo.ca
