7.2 vacation days, pay, and overtime 7.2 payment of vacation days, overtime, severance work terms in ontario in a recognized co-operative program are considered part of the educational experience. according to regulation 325 of the ontario employment standards act (esa),  "a person who performs work under a program approved by a community college or university" (co-op student) is exempt from the act. this means that employers are not required to provide students on official co-op education work terms with vacation pay, overtime pay, or statutory holidays.  most employers, however, will include compensation for these as part of your salary. also, because co-op students are not covered under the esa, employers are not required to provide notice and/or severance pay in case of termination of employment before the agreed upon end date of the work term. you may wish to take a day or two off during a work term. employers are not required to provide vacation days, but they will usually agree if the request is reasonable. they are also not required to provide time off for statutory holidays (but usually do). an exception to the above may occur to be when students are employed by an industry under federal jurisdiction such as post offices, radio stations, banks, airlines, railways, and television stations. in this case workers are covered under the canada labour code . if you wish to know what compensation you are entitled to, contact an ontario ministry of labour and/or human resources development canada office for advice. it is in your best interest to find out the employer's policy on compensation during the job application/interview process. be sure to look into the compensation regulations of the jurisdiction of your employer if you will be working outside of ontario. employers often handle absences in the same manner as other temporary full-time employees.
