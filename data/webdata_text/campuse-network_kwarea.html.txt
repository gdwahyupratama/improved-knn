uw kw-area connectivity uwng kw-area factors 1999-01-21 uw's kw-area connectivity is via analog dial-up lines using 33.6kbps modems. one of the most promising new technologies for home-to-campus connectivity is likely to be "universal asynchronous digital subscriber line" (uadsl), which will involve a "splitterless" home interface device that is uadsl on the telco side and ethernet on the home-computer side, enabling standard "voice" telephony plus ip networking over the same copper phone line. the network connection is permanent (always "on"). the carrier will transmit the home subscriber's ip traffic via its ip network. cable companies are pursuing offerings based on shared-medium catv coax to the home, with a home device that is catv on the cableco side and ethernet on the home-computer side, with the ip traffic backhauled to the institution on an atm transmission system. the new docsis data-over-cable technology will address the traffic-spying security exposures inherent in a shared-medium transmission system. for more information, see the uw rfi for high-speed ip connectivity to the kw-area homes of uw faculty, staff, and students. maintained by rwwatt@uwaterloo.ca
