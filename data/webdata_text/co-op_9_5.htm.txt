9.5 subjects 9.5 subjects your work report must have an identifiable analytic component. a report that compares and evaluates several items or alternatives using various criteria is analytical. a report on a single topic can be analytic if it discusses advantages and disadvantages. you could, for example, evaluate the way that the company implements r&d or wage incentive plans. a report is unacceptable if it only contains a narrative, if it is simply a users' guide or other documentation, or if you simply summarize your work term tasks. an analytic report contains constructive criticism and contains conclusions and recommendations. if you have difficulty identifying conclusions, then you likely have insufficient analytic content. although the topic does not have to be your idea, the report must be your own work and you are required to make a signed declaration to this effect. the work report is evaluated as a professional document. your work report grade is based on the factual content and accuracy of the report as well as its presentation and clarity.
