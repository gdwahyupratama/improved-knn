6.2 develop learning objectives 6.2 develop learning objectives sometimes it is difficult for you to predict your employer's expectations. it may be equally difficult to establish specific learning objectives prior to beginning your employment. before going to your job, and perhaps during the first week, you should set general objectives based on your current knowledge. as knowledge of the job increases, your learning objectives become more specific. once you set specific objectives, be prepared to stick with them. be prepared to explain why these objectives were not achieved. your field co-ordinator will discuss your objectives during the worksite visit. for the remainder of the term, strive to achieve your objectives. at the end of your work term, assess your success and discuss the results with your field co-ordinator during your return-to-campus interview. consider the following points: do not set too many objectives. a small number of good objectives are more useful. objectives should be specific and measurable, realistic and obtainable. for example, instead of saying "i am going to try to save some money towards tuition," say, "i will save $100.00 each month." what are your personal and career objectives? what new skills, work habits, and attitudes can you achieve? a learning objective should state what you want to achieve during your work term and the level of experience you want to reach.
