job shadow job shadow you have read about and talked with others about a particular type of work. you think that it would be a good fit for your interests and capabilities, but you would like to do one more check. that is when the job shadow experience is very beneficial. to locate the ideal person, use the same strategy you did to find a person with whom you did an information interview. writing or telephoning to make arrangements to meet is similar, except that you will ask for a ½-day or an entire day. during that time together, you are able to ask similar questions to those in the information interview. the bonus is spending time with your contact as that person does whatever needs to be done that day on the job. you can observe, perhaps even help. by the time you are ready to leave, you should have good notes about the components of the job, the work environment, the interactions with other people, and a tally on what you like and dislike about the position. if the fit is not as good as you had hoped, ask your contact if there would be a different type of place where that kind of work would be done, e.g., market research talking with people in a shopping mall vs. over the telephone. within 1-2 days after your visit, write your thank-you letter and mail it. include points about what you found helpful. whether you have made a decision to work in the field is not important to your contact, only that the time spent with you was not a waste.
