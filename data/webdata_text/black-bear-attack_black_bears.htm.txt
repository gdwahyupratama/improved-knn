black bears ursus americanusblack bears are chunky in shape, 1.5  1.8 m long and almost 1 m tall at the shoulder. on average, males weigh 115  170 kg, while females are smaller at 90  155 kg. their weight however varies considerably with the season. they are heaviest in the fall, when they may gain as much as 14 kg in a week, but after an extended fast during hibernation, they are rather thin when they emerge in the spring.black bears have a broad head and short neck. they eyes are small and black, the ears rounded and the snout long. a short tail is usually obscured by the bear's long coarse hair. colours range from blond to brown to black, but in the northwest territories the most common is black, with a tan muzzle and often a white v on the chest.their eyesight is poor but their senses of hearing and smell are excellent. they can run surprisingly quickly, gathering their feet together underneath themselves and bounding through the trees. they also swim well and are capable of covering distances of 1 km in the water. bears are plantigrade, which means they walk with their feet flat on the ground like a man. short, curved, non-retractable claws are used for tree climbing, at which black bears are extremely adept. cubs in particular spend much time in trees, where they rest and sun themselves, or seek refuge when danger threatens. this is one of the reasons why black bear mothers are considerably less threatening to intruders than grizzly mothers. the grizzly's adaptation to danger is to stand its ground or attack, while the black bear in its forest habitat has a convenient escape route. material originally published in 1992 as part of the nwt wildlife sketch series, department of resources, wildlife and economic development.
