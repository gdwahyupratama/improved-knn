uwng strategy uwng strategy 1997-07-18 it is, simply, an ip world. the campus network is an ip network. the focus of the next-generation national and regional networks is on ip. production-quality applications software for video and voice will emerge using ip multicast and ip bandwidth allocation as their enablers. we need a campus-network transmission system that routes and delivers ip packets at high speed and with low latency between server and desktop devices on ethernet transmission systems interconnected by devices that facilitate the integration of ip routing and ethernet switching. that same transmission system must also continue to carry non-ip traffic between ethernet-connected devices (eg, for appletalk and a watstar virtual backbone). we must strive to achieve the optimum balance of the following ... affordabilityavoid spending more or sooner than is warranted. extendibilityavoid choices that will preclude the ability to pursue alternatives that may become important in the future. longevitysecure management approval to fund for on-going evolution in subsequent years. measurabilityextend the centralized measurement of traffic loading and the projection of traffic growth all the way out to the workgroup-switch ports, rather than just the backbone ports. scalabilityover-design. avoid choices that leave inadequate room for growth. simplicityavoid choices that can be avoided. survivabilityavoid single points of failure. vendor alliancechoose one single vendor that has all of the necessary transmission, switching, and routing products and has established long-term marketplace leadership. maintained by rwwatt@uwaterloo.ca
