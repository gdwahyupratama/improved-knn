health services - university of waterloo how is health services different from a doctor's office off-campus? our service has been developed to support students and some features are not found in doctor's offices or walk-in clinics. these include health promotion programs, crisis intervention, advocacy for uw health concerns off campus, public health alerts, management of the drug formulary, assistance with the student supplementary health plan (sshp) benefits and dispensing (at no cost to students covered by the sshp) birth control medication and routine immunizations. the nurses will offer every kind of help from ear piercing to a shoulder to cry on, so don't hesitate to come to health services if you aren't sure where else to go. we don't know all the answers, but we care for you and will do what we can to connect you with the appropriate resources. what if you do not have ohip coverage? ohip has a reciprocal agreement with all provinces except quebec; therefore we are able to bill these provinces through ohip. if you are covered by quebec or uhip, each time you come to health services you will be asked to sign a form which will allow our billing staff to submit claims to your insurance carrier for you. uhip is the coverage, which replaces ohip, for international students. last update april 03, 2001 this page maintained by chris strome. copyright © university of waterloo
