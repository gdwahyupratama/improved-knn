<H1>Black Bear (<i>Ursus americanus</i>)</H1>

<p>
The black bear is the largest carnivore in NH, up to 325 lbs, but 
rarely do they
attack live prey.  Their diet consists mainly of grasses, roots, 
berries and other plant matter.  Most of the meat they eat is
carrion, but they do eat insects and small animals occasionally.
They will feed on garbage and human food, so it is imperative to
protect your camping food by hanging or locking it in a secure
place such as a car trunk.
</p>

<p>
Males are mostly solitary, but the cubs stay with their mothers for
up to two year.  Sows are very protective of their cubs and will
attack if threatened.  They are fast runners (25 MPH) and skilled
tree climbers.
