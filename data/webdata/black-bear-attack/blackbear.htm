Bears</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>Black Bears are the smallest
and most encountered bears in North America among black, brown/grizzly,
and polar bears, and are the only bears found in the eastern United States.&nbsp;
Maine is lucky enough to have one of the most prosperous black bear populations
east of the Mississippi estimated at an excess of 22,000 bears.&nbsp; Black
Bears prefer substantial tracts of undisturbed land with mature spruce
fir, although adept well to man’s development.&nbsp; They can run as fast
as 25 miles an hour, and have a superb climbing ability.&nbsp; Adult males
average 250 to 600 pounds, females average 100 to 400 pounds.&nbsp; Males
measure five to six feet in length from the tip of their nose to the tip
of their tail; female’s average four to five feet in length.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>Unlike grizzly bears, black
Bears seldom attack humans.&nbsp; According to the National Center for
Statistics, 1980-1983, for every death caused by a black bear, 17 deaths
are caused by spiders, 25 deaths caused by (from) snakes, 67 deaths from
dogs, and 180 deaths from wasps and bees.&nbsp; On average, fewer than
three people are killed every year by the more than 650,000 black bears
in America.&nbsp; Surprisingly, Black Bear mothers rarely attack humans
when defending their cubs.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>Black Bears talk to each other
with grunts.&nbsp; When communicating with people, bears blow loudly signaling
fear.&nbsp; When cubs communicate distress, they scream; when communicating
happiness, they hum.&nbsp; Black bears do not growl.&nbsp; Another way
bears communicate is by scratching trees in order to leave their scent
to tell others bears that they are and how they feel.</font></font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>Black bears do not rely very
much on food they kill themselves.&nbsp; It has been reported that animals
killed by black bears constitute less than one percent of the bears diet.&nbsp;
Nesting birds, penned livestock, and fish are among the bear’s diet, in
addition to blueberries, corn, and honey.&nbsp; The bears use their sense
of smell in order to locate desired food …</font></font>
<br><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size=-1>Black bears hibernate as a
way of avoiding the scarcity of food brought by the long Maine winters.&nbsp;
Bears select dens in which to sleep which include hollowed out trees and
caves.&nbsp; Bears make insulative beds for their dens by gathering leaves,
twigs, and grass.&nbsp; Bears hibernate alone in their dens except for
mothers who sleep with their cubs.&nbsp; During hibernation, usually from
December to April, the bears metabolic rates are cut in half and the sleeping
heart rate drops to between 8 and 40 beats per minute from between 60 and
90 beats per minute.&nbsp; Black bears are not true hibernators as they
sometimes leave the den for short periods of time.&nbsp; It has been reported
that less than one percent of bears die during hibernation.&nbsp; In January,
new cubs are born weighing less than one pound with a light covering of
fir.&nbsp; By the age of 2 to 3 months, cubs are able to leave the den
with their mother.&nbsp; The mother has a lot of responsibility as father
bears do not help in the raising of the cubs.&nbsp; Sadly nearly half of
all newborn cubs die before their first birthday due to starvation.&nbsp;
If the bear makes it to his second birthday his chance of survival is increased
approximately 90%, after such time that most deaths are due to man.&nbsp;</font></font></td>
