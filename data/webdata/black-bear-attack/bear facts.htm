<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">Their hearing is more sensitive than a human's</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">They stand upright to see farther.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">They run faster than 25 mph.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">They climb trees as fast as squirrels.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">The most common black bear sounds are grunts.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">The sound most often heard by people is a
    loud blowing, which means a black bear is nervous or afraid.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">Cubs readily scream in distress, whine when
    approaching their mother or give a tremulous hum when nursing or comfortably
    warm.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">Adults (and cubs) use their
    &quot;voices&quot; when in pain (bawling), in fear (moaning), in combat
    (bellowing) or when seriously threatened (deep-throated pulsing sound).
    Unlike cats and dogs, black bears seldom, if ever, growl, although the
    fear-moans of treed or trapped bears are often mistaken for growls.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">They have color vision, which might explain
    why bears do most of their foraging for fruit in daylight. For night vision,
    they have a reflector system in their eyes that brightens night images and
    gives them their eye shine.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">Black bears are classified as members of the
    older Carnivora, and their teeth, claws, strength and size make them look
    like predators. However, they seldom catch anything larger than insects.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">Their claws are tightly curved for
    tree-climbing, so black bears have an advantage over grizzly bears, deer and
    wild hogs when competing for acorns, nuts and fruits.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">Cubs stay with their mothers till they are
    about 17 months old.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">Most females in northern evergreen forest do
    not produce cubs until 5 to 8 years of age, while those in hardwood forest
    usually produce their first cubs at 3 or 4 years of age. This is do to food
    availability.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">Most black bears use a different den each
    year.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">Hibernation last up to 7 months in the
    northern region, but is shorter in the South.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">To survive long winters without eating,
    drinking, exercising or passing wastes, hibernating black bears will cut
    their metabolic rate in half.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">Except for mothers with cubs, black bears are
    solitary animals.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">Although black bears have a lifespan of 30
    years, they rarely live that long because they die from human-related causes
    that kill them before they are 6 years old on average.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">Although some black bears die from falling
    out of trees or being hit by cars, very few bears die from disease, making
    humans their greatest threat.</font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font size="5">Bears have long-term memory and are
    recognized as one of the more intelligent mammals.</font></li>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial Black" size="4">300 BLACK BEARS SAVED BY
PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME</font><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial">
</font><font face="Arial Black">The number one environmental problem facing New
Jersey right now is the loss of open space. The little farms of our state are no
longer able to compete with the huge farms of California and Florida that send
their produce by truck, train and plane to our stores. So our New Jersey farmers
are selling their land to developers, people with lots of money who turn the
farms into houses, shopping malls, and the headquarters of big business so they
can accumulate more money.</font><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arial Black">A
ride on a New Jersey road is just not the same as it used to be. Where we used
to be able to enjoy open farmland for miles and miles, we now travel on widened
highways that eat up the land. And that's not all-they eat up animal habitats
too.</font><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial Black"> In 1980
there were about 200 black bears living in the mountains and forest of New
Jersey. They had the water, the food, and the space to live comfortably. Now we
have to close to 2000! Isn't it wonderful that our little state, third smallest
in the nation, filled with 8 million people, still has enough quality habitat
for 2000 bears?</font><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial Black">
However, it seemed like it was all coming to an end for these magnificent
creatures. With more and more land being taken from them, it was thought that
they were getting too close for comfort. But it wasn't so much that they were
maliciously intruding on property of home owners, it was just that there was no
place left for them to go.</font>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial Black"> Imagine...where there 
  was once a forest or a field, there are now 300 homes. Is it really the bears' 
  fault that they are seen in the area of those homes? Or are they simply doing 
  what they have always done? By the way, there has never been a black bear attack 
  on a human being in the history of our state. When it comes to human beings, 
  black bears are chickens!</font>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial Black"> Yet the N.J. Department 
  of Fish and Game made a decision to have hunters kill 300 black bears on this 
  past September 18th. They said it was a way of controlling the population of 
  an animal that was becoming a pest, but they were not to have their way.</font>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial Black">
Once realizing that black bears were going to be hunted, thousands of people
took time from their busy lives to write, e-mail or telephone our state
legislators, including Governor Christie Whitman. A week before the proposed
hunt, she called it off! As you read this they are trying to come up with new
solutions to the problem of black bears in New Jersey, but one solution will not
be to kill them off. It is now realized that they are a wonderful addition to
our state, an indicator that our environment is very much better than it once
was.</font><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial Black"> We have
2000 large, beautiful predators&nbsp; here in New Jersey that roam wild and
free. The people of our little, crowded state have spoke and the message was
heard: leave them be! Never think no one will listen, together we can make a
difference.</font>
