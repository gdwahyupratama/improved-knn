    SURVIVAL GUIDE</i></b></font></p>

    <p><img src="UpDa3.gif" width="360" height="257"

    naturalsizeflag="3"></p>

    <p>This material is intended for those government agencies

    and companies who are using my first book as a safety

    training manual.</p>

    <p>I started research for my second book in February, 1996,

    by interviewing bear attack victims and conservation

    officers. Each interview is carefully recorded, then typed,

    and sent back to the victim or survivor for an accuracy

    check.</p>

    <p>In my first book, I concentrated on bear attack survival

    and deliberately avoided the human tragedy aspect of bear

    attacks. This next book will clearly demonstrate the horrific

    detailed nature of bear attacks, what went through the

    person's mind during the attack, and the effects of bear

    attack trauma.</p>

    <p>While doing this research, I discovered some important

    points about encounters, attacks, and spray-use that I didn't

    know when I published <i>Encounters</i>.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>#1 - I have recorded six recent encounters or attacks

    where the people involved yelled at a bear (both black and

    grizzly) that had already given an aggressive signal (blowing

    or growling), and the yell triggered an attack. In most of

    these cases, the bear had smelled the person and was standing

    on its hind legs trying to locate where the individual was.

    In each case, the person yelled in order to let the bear know

    where they were, assuming that the bear would then take off

    in the opposite direction. These were all

    defensive-aggressive attacks.</p>

    <p>I also have two accounts of armed people getting bears to

    back down by aggressively yelling at them.</p>

    <p>** I strongly suggest that if you are only carrying spray

    or have no defence system at all, do not yell at a bear that

    is blowing, growling, or popping its teeth and trying to

    locate you visually. Stand still and be quiet; it will most

    likely leave in a hurry after about a minute. This principle

    pertains to defensive-aggressive attacks only.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>#2 - Black bears have hooked claws and can hook-climb

    trees all their lives. Grizzly cubs have the same capability,

    but in the fourth and fifth year of a grizzly's life, its

    claws straighten out and it loses the ability to hook-climb.

    Many adult grizzlies can still climb trees by lunging up a

    limbless trunk, by climbing on strong limbs, or by hugging

    the tree.</p>

    <p>I have four recent accounts where adult grizzlies climbed

    trees and yanked the victims to the ground. I also have an

    account of a young man who scrambled up an eight-inch birch

    tree to a crotch 12 feet of the ground as an enraged

    bellowing sow charged him from 200 yards distance. The bear

    lunged up the tree, hugged it, and proceeded to climb to

    within 18 inches of its intended victim. At this point the

    bear received a heavy dose of bear spray down its gullet as

    it was breathing in, and the attack came to an end.</p>

    align="middle" width="216" height="300" naturalsizeflag="3"></p>

    <p>Alan Hobler climbed this eight-inch birch tree as a sow

    grizzly charged down this trail.</p>

    <p>** Even though Alan Hobler's tree climbing strategy was

    successful, I have two accounts that were unsuccessful where

    people tried to spray the bear after climbing a tree. I

    believe that in most cases a person is better off to stand

    behind a tree and spray an attacking grizzly at about eight

    to ten feet distance.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>#3 - This spring was a particularly bad year for predatory

    black bear encounters and attacks in northern B.C. It was a

    late cold spring with bears out of their dens and no plant

    foods to eat. In two barely successful cases of spray

    defense, the black bears were sprayed twice and still did not

    leave the area. The spray cans carried were the small size.

    The average spray time on bears is three to four seconds.

    This means that a small can has two blasts.</p>

    <p>** I strongly recommend that you carry the larger 260 gram

    size spray or two of the smaller cans - you made need it. The

    spray must be carried on your hip in a holster or in a front

    pocket of a cruiser vest. <b>Do not carry spray in the back

    of a vest - </b>some people have paid dearly for this

    mistake. The bear must be sprayed at close range (eight to

    ten feet) so that if the wind is blowing in your direction,

    the bear will get more spray than you. Every person in a

    group must have spray. Two people standing side-by-side with

    sprays is a very effective defense system.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>#4 - Phazer bear spray has issued a recall for some of its

    products. If you are carrying Phazer, contact your supplier

    and ask for information about the recall. If they do not know

    about it, ask them for the wholesaler's name so that you can

    call them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>#5 - Bear Guard has now come out with a 260 gram size

    canister. This is the size you need.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>#6 - Counter Assault bear spray will be back on the

    Canadian market in the near future.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>There is presently considerable confusion about how well

    sprays work against bears. The new viewpoint by some

    biologists is that sprays work well against grizzlies but not

    very well against black bears. There are some important

    principles being overlooked by these people.</p>

    <p>There are two types of spray data: First, spray-use

    against habituated problem bears; second, spray-use against

    wild attacking bears. Most spray-use accounts against black

    bears are the habituated variety, and most spray-use accounts

    against grizzlies are wild attacking bears. Habituated bears

    respond differently to sprays than wild attacking bears.

    Habituated bears often move off a short distance when

    sprayed, then return quickly. Spray-use against wild

    attacking bears usually has a one-time skunk effect where the

    bear swaps ends and runs away blinded, swatting its face. But

    there's more to the picture than this.</p>

    <p>When I carefully examine spray-use accounts against black

    bears only, I see three categories:</p>

    <blockquote>

        <p>First is the habituated black bear in a park setting

        or on someone's porch. Under these circumstances, sprays

        are often ineffective.</p>

        <p>Second is the attacking black bear in a

        defensive-aggressive behavioural mode.These are usually

        sows defending cubs, but there are few accounts in this

        category. This type of bear is almost always repelled by

        spray, much like the defensive-aggressive attacks by

        grizzlies.</p>

        <p>Third is the most important category: predatory black

        bear attacks. These bears respond to sprays in unusual

        ways that you must understand if you are going to save

        yourself against a predatory bear.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>The following account will show you how difficult dealing

    with a predatory bear can be:</p>

    <p>On May 16, 1996, a T.D.B. engineer was working by himself

    in a cut-block north of Prince George, B.C. He was doing GPS

    locations of the creeks in the area. Earlier in the day the

    belt buckle had come off his belt (his spray was in a holster

    on his belt) so he had to put his bear spray in the back of

    his vest.</p>

    <p>As he was moving along he saw a large black bear

    approaching from his left in a fast walk. As he turned to

    face the bear and started trying to reach the spray, he

    realized he wouldn't get it in time. The bear was only ten

    feet away when he threw his hat off to the side of the bear;

    it immediately pounced on the hat and started ripping it

    apart.</p>

    <p>The bear was occupied with the hat for about ten seconds,

    then turned and headed towards its intended victim when it

    received a three-second blast of spray at a distance of five

    feet. It immediately backed up about ten feet, coughing and

    shaking its head. It put its face down into the ground moss

    and started rubbing the spray off.</p>

    <p>The engineer started walking at a fast pace towards his

    pickup. After he travelled about 200 feet he saw the bear

    paralleling him off to the side. It disappeared, and then a

    couple minutes later came out in front of him and, once

    again, came at him in a fast walk.</p>

    <p>The second blast was at about the same distance, and the

    bear reacted with the same backing up and wiping his face in

    the moss routine. The young man then semi-circled the

    determined bear and headed for the road in a fast trot. He

    kept looking back and sure enough, after a few minutes, the

    bear was hot on his trail but stayed back about 100 feet, not

    wanting a third blast.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, this was the happiest engineer in B.C.

    when he arrived at the truck, because he had used up all of

    his spray with the second blast.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>This account is one of five predatory black bear attacks

    that I have collected so far that happened this spring in

    B.C. The others are very similar in the amount of spray used

    and the determination displayed by the bear.</p>

    <p>There are some important points to consider when using

    sprays against black bears:</p>

    <blockquote>

        <p># 1 - You need plenty of spray; the 260 gram size can

        or two smaller cans.</p>

        <p># 2 - Your spray <b>must</b> be in a holster on your

        belt for quick use.</p>

        <p># 3 - Everyone in a group must have spray and be ready

        to use it simultaneously.</p>

        <p># 4 - The effect on the bear may be temporary, so

        leave immediately.</p>

        <p># 5 - If you are dealing with a persistent bear and

        you use up all of your spray, beat the bear off with

        anything available.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p>When somebody uses a spray against a bear and the effect

    is minimal, it's hard for them to believe that sprays could

    work at all. But remember this: for every spray failure,

    there are three successes. I would be lying if I stated that

    I understood completely why sprays can fail miserably in some

    cases and work so dramatically in others. The most important

    effect a spray has on a bear is the asphyxiation aspect. It

    can be a matter of luck as to whether the bear is breathing

    in, or has its mouth open, when the spray hits it.</p>

    <p>My next book will have many spray-use accounts that will

    help clarify what sprays can and cannot do.</p>

    <p>Every year in B.C. there are three to four people who save

    themselves from death or injury with sprays. Even though

    spray success runs at about 75%, it is a far better strategy

    than the 'play dead/fight back' concept. Personally, I always

    carry a gun.</p>
