Following up on the recent postings about bears attacking
campers, the San Francisco Examiner ran this sidebar to an
article about bears in its Sunday, August 18, 1996, edition:

<STRONG>BEAR ATTACKS</STRONG>

<UL>
  <LI> Tom Stienstra
<STRONG>EXAMINER COLUMNIST</STRONG>

</UL>
<P>
No one has been killed in an attack by a California black
bear, and attacks are so rare that each merits full
investigation by the state. But regardless, attacks are on
the rise.

<P>
Since 1993 there have been seven verified incidents, while
in the previous 10 years, there had been only three.

<P>
Here is a synopsis of bear attacks documented in the past 10
years in California, provided by bear expert Bob Stafford of
the Department of Fish and Game:

<P>
*July 1996: In Angeles National Forest in Southern
California, a bear entered a campground at night and bit a
woman's foot while she was in her sleeping bag. No report
was made, the campers went back to sleep, and four hours
later, the bear returned and bit the head of an 8-year-old
boy, one of the most serious bear-caused injuries ever
recorded.

<P>
*April 1996: In the town of Mammoth in the eastern Sierra, a
bear approached a man working on his pick-up truck at his
home, bit him in the butt, then ran off.

<P>
*June 1995: At Desolation Wilderness near Lake Tahoe, a bear
approached a camp late at night, apparently in search of
food, reached out and gashed a 13-year-old boy, leaving him
with scrape wounds and a headache.

<P>
*April 1995: In Shasta-Trinity National Forest, a man found
what he thought was an abandoned cub but was actually a
70-pound yearling, put it in his vehicle and said he was
driving it to an animal protection facility. In the two days
that followed, two women joined on the trip, and while
driving in the town of Mt. Shasta, received minor injuries
from the yearling while in the car.

<P>
*August 1993: In San Bernardino National Forest east of Los
Angeles, two near identical but separate incidents occurred
within three days of each other at campgrounds. In each
case, a bear grabbed 13-year-old males who were sleeping and
tried to drag them away. Though the boys were scared, only
minor injuries were inflicted.

<P>
*May 1993: At Shasta Lake near Redding, a man camping with
garbage littering his campsite woke up to a bear drooling on
him. When the man sat up, the bear swatted him on the head,
leaving a small gash that required three stitches, then ran
off.

<P>
*August 1991: In the Marble Mountain Wilderness in Siskiyou
County, a man was trying to photograph a bear within a few
feet when he suddenly noticed it was a female with two cubs.
The bear charged him and bit him around the shoulders. When
the film was developed, it included a photograph of a bear
with an open mouth one foot away.

<P>
*May 1986: In the Trinity Alps north of Weaverville, a man
camped in a tent found himself caught in the middle of a
fight between two bears. One of the bears attacked him,
biting him in the shoulder and swatting him once in the
back of the head. The man hit the bear with a tent pole, the
bear retreated, fought again with the other bear, then left.

<P>
*September 1986: In remote Siskiyou County near the Oregon
border, a man who had been feeding bears at his house for 30
years was cuffed around but otherwise uninjured.

<P>
Note that none of the victims were reported to have been
menstruating (not even the females.)  In fact, several of
these attacks would seem to have been instigated by the
humans, which leads to the second bear story to hit the Bay
Area newspapers lately--in which we learn that the bears may
have more to fear thjan the campers:

Yosemite Campers Kill Bear -- Apparently While Saving Food
(Friday, August 16, 1996)<BR>
Steve Rubenstein, Harriet Chiang, Chronicle Staff Writers

<P>
A group of campers stoned a 2-year-old black bear to death
in a backcountry campground at Yosemite National Park,
rangers said yesterday.

<P>
The incident, which occurred Monday night in the Little
Yosemite Valley area, about five miles from the Yosemite
Valley trailhead, was reported by witnesses to rangers on
Tuesday, according to acting Chief Ranger Don Coelho.

<P>
``There does not appear to be a good reason for what they
did,'' Coelho said, adding that the attack on the bear did
not appear to be self-defense by the campers. ``It looked
like it had been stoned to death.''

<P>
A park ranger found and photographed the dead animal, which
weighed about 100 pounds. Coelho said it had died from
``blunt trauma.''

<P>
Investigators questioned the campers, believed to be a youth
group and two chaperones from Huntington Beach in Orange
County. No arrests were made, but Coelho said rangers are
taking the incident ``extremely seriously'' and will
"attempt to prove a case'' of destruction of wildlife.
Rangers allowed the youth group and two chaperones to
continue their trip, and they were expected to leave
Yosemite yesterday.

<P>
Park wildlife biologist Steve Thompson, whose department was
investigating the attack, said the chaperones were throwing
large rocks to drive the bear away from the campers' food,
which had been improperly stored. At least one of the rocks
struck the bear in the head, he said.

<P>
Rangers were trying to determine if additional injuries were
inflicted on the animal and whether others participated in
the attack. Thompson said rangers issued citations to the
chaperones, who were not identified.

<P>
News of the attack was the talk of park employees, who were
angry and horrified. Many employees used radio scanners to
monitor rangers' conversations about the attack.

<P>
``None of us can believe anyone would do this,'' said Allen
Mourton, assistant manager at the Tuolumne Meadows store.
``It makes you wonder what people are teaching their kids.
We all want to make sure that nobody gets away with
something like this.''

<P>
Representatives of the National Park Service declined to
provide information about the incident, saying it was
``under investigation.''

most of your time, doesn't it?"
