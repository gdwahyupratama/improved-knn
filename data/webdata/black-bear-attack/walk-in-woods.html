<p><font size="+1">Fatal <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">Bear </B><B style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">Attack</B></font> - On May 21, two <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">black</B> bears attacked 
  and killed a woman in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. This is the first 
  fatal <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear </B><B style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">attack</B> that has ever occurred not only inside the Park, but also 
  in the entire southeastern portion of the United States. The 50-year-old local 
  woman was fishing with her ex husband. Her ex left her for about an hour before 
  looking for her. He found her untouched daypack, then found her with two bears 
  standing over the body. The incident occurred near the Little River in the Elkmont 
  section of the Park. Park Rangers responded and killed the two bears. The 112-pound 
  female and her 40 pound yearling had both preyed on the body. Although complete 
  examinations of the bears and woman are not yet complete, early indications 
  are the bears came upon her while she was laying down, perhaps napping. In recorded 
  history, there have been a total of 43 fatal <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">black </B><B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> attacks in North America. 
  In general, the frequency of attacks increase as you go north in latitude. Over 
  the last 10 years, there has been an average of one <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">black </B><B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> caused fatality 
  a year, compared to two for grizzly bears. With an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 
  <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">black</B> bears in North America, and over 350 million humans, <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> attacks are 
  an extremely rare occurrence. This <B style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">attack</B> will be studied thoroughly to try 
  to determine what lead these bears to kill. This tragedy should help remind 
  us all that <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">black</B> bears are wild animals. They need to be respected while we 
  travel in their home, but not feared. Throughout the United States, man, not 
  bears, is the top predator. Especially in the southeast, <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">black</B> bears are only 
  opportunistic carnivores. They will eat meat when they can get it, but they 
  will not usually expend a lot of energy to get it. As an example, in the 30+ 
  years bears have been studied inside the Park, there has never been any evidence 
  that a <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">black </B><B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> has eaten a trout! If they come across a careless, weak, sick, 
  dead or injured animal, they will eat it, but a vast majority of their diet 
  comes from roots, insects, berries, nuts and other plant matter. </p>

<p><font size="+1"><B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">Bear</B> Incident Provides Lessons</font> - A &quot;<B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">Bear </B><B style="color:black;background-color:#99ff99">Attack</B>&quot; 
  last summer provides a great lesson on how not to act around bears. A man came 
  across a <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> jam on the Cades Cove Loop Road caused by a <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> cub on the side 
  of the road. The man grabbed his video camera and began filming. He walked up 
  to the <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> cub, and the cub ran into the woods. The man followed close behind. 
  The cub ran up to its mother, and two of its siblings. The man continued filming 
  as he approached the family. The sow snorted a warning at the man, but he continued 
  filming. The <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> then commenced her final warning sign, a false charge. The 
  man dropped his camera and took off running. The <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> quickly caught up to him, 
  and slapped him down with her paw. The man fell on a log with several sharp 
  protrusions, and impaled himself on the log. The sow left the man lying prone, 
  and took her family off into the woods. The Park Service ruled the <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> was 
  within her rights defending her family, and the <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> was not removed from the 
  area. The lessons? 1. No matter how cute they look, never approach a <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B>. 2. 
  Stay away from <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> cubs, they will be defended. 3. Never run from a <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> (even 
  though <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">black</B> bears are only opportunistic carnivores, any predator has a deep 
  instinct to chase something that runs). 4. Most importantly, <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">black</B> bears are 
  nothing to be feared, they are to be respected. In this example, the <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> had 
  the person who threatened her cubs totally helpless lying injured on a log and 
  she walked away. <B style="color:black;background-color:#ffff66">Black</B> bears do not hunt people, and usually run away as soon 
  as they are aware of their presence. With a little common sense and respect, 
  coming across a <B style="color:black;background-color:#A0FFFF">bear</B> in the wild will provide memories to last a lifetime.</p>

<p><font size="+1">All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory</font> - A huge project is 
  beginning in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It is estimated that there 
  are over 100,000 species of life within the boundaries of the park, but only 
  about 10,000 have been cataloged. A new type of organization,<a href="http://www.discoverlife.org"> 
  Discover Life </a>in America, is going to attempt to catalogue all species of 
  life in the Park boundaries over the next 12 to 15 years. <a href="http://www.discoverlife.org">Discover 
  Life</a> is a partnership of universities, colleges, museums, government agencies, 
  corporate sponsors, and volunteers. One of the organizations goals is to have 
  one web page for each species of life in the park, complete with all known information 
  on the species. Volunteers of any age and from all over the world are wanted 
  to participate in the project. Some early finding, a tarantula the size of a 
  mite, and seven species of flies new to science. </p>

<p align="left"><a href="#topwalk"></a><font size="+1">Red Wolf Introduction Program 
  Ends</font> - The eight-year effort to reintroduce Red Wolves into the park 
  has ended. The remaining wolves will be captured before winter and moved elsewhere. 
  Although the adult wolves released into the park did well, none of the pups 
  lived through a winter. Parvo, lack of game, predation from coyotes and other 
  wolves have been offered as reasons for the failure of young wolves to survive 
  in the Park. The biggest underlying reason seems to be that red wolves are not 
  suited to life in the mountains. The wolves mostly stayed around the low country 
  of Cades Cove. </p>

<p align="left"><font size="+1">Elk to Be Released In Park - With a few hurdles 
  left to go, it now seems likely that the Park will begin an experimental program 
  of re-introducing Elk into the Park in Jan/Feb 2001. The plan is to release 
  25 animals into the Park each year for several years. The animals will be radio 
  collared and monitored closely. The last reported elk in the area was shot and 
  killed in Tennessee in 1849. Before being hunted to extinction, elk were plentiful 
  throughout the entire Appalachian Mountain system.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">1998 Safest in Park History</font> - Only one person died in 
  the Park in 1998, the fewest fatalities on record. The one person died in April 
  while attempting to swim across the Little Pigeon River. Most Park fatalities 
  are due to traffic accidents. The decrease in traffic fatalities is welcome, 
  but mysterious. According to Park spokesperson Nancy Gray, &quot;I would like 
  to believe people are being more careful, then again it could just be the luck 
  of the draw.&quot; Unfortunately, 1999 will not match the '98 figure. Already 
  there have been at least 4 fatalities inside the Park. In mid April, a small 
  plane went down south of the AT in the western section of the Park killing the 
  pilot, and in June, a 67 year old man died of natural causes during a lone AT 
  hike from Clingman's Dome to Fontanna. July rains helped contribute to two unrelated 
  drowning incidents inside the Park. </p>

<p><font size="+1">Peregrine Falcons Are Back - </font>The endangered peregrine 
  falcon is alive and well inside the Park. The Park Service conducted an effort 
  from 1984-86 to reintroduce the birds to the area. Another bird was re-released 
  into the Park on 6/1/99 after spending eight months in rehab at the Second Chance 
  Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Whittier NC. The bird was discovered by Park 
  Ranger Dean Mihelich with a compound fracture of its leg. The peregrine falcons 
  are the fastest animals on earth, achieving speeds close to 200 m.p.h. during 
  their power dives. The peregrine falcon was removed from the Federal Endangered 
  Species List this summer, but is still on the Tennessee Endangered list. There 
  are only two known nesting sites in Tennessee, one inside the Park, and one 
  in Chattanooga.</p>

<p><font size="+1">Walking Improves Memory</font> - Research published this summer 
  in the journal Nature concludes that vigorous walking helps brain function. 
  Experiments conducted at the University of Illinois showed marked improvement 
  in people's "executive control functions" when walking three times a week. Executive 
  control functions, ability to make, reconsider and remember choices, establishing 
  and managing plans and schedules, help older people live independently. Activities 
  like weight lifting and other anaerobic exercises did not improve these functions.</p>

<p><font size="+1">Park Now Part of The Lonely Planet - </font>Erik and Vesna 
  of A Walk in the Woods led Ian Wright and the Brittish crew from The Lonely 
  Planet on an overnight trip to Mt. LeConte Lodge in early August. The Lonely 
  Planet is a travel show that has aired for the past five years on the Discover 
  and Travel Channels and is viewed by 35 million people worldwide. The segment 
  will be part of The Lonely Planet's Guide to the Deep South, and will air in 
  late December or early January. The trip was a great success. Some highlights 
  were a meal that Ian ate of food totally foraged during our hike up, and a perfect
