<p align="left"><strong>Grizzly Bear encounters and attacks are extremely rare</strong>.
&nbsp; A person visiting Yellowstone or Glacier National Park is much more likely to be
injured in an automobile accident or a fall than by a grizzly bear.&nbsp; The overwhelming
odds against being injured by a grizzly bear are widely reported--I will not recite them
here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that--grizzlies are powerful animals with the ability to
inflict severe wounds with little effort.&nbsp; Precautions should be taken to try to
avoid an encounter when entering Grizzly Country, but there are no hard and fast rules to
ensure an encounter will not occur.&nbsp; How does one avoid an encounter? &nbsp; If an
encounter occurs, what action should one take?&nbsp; Books have been written on the
subject and the National Park Service and others provide information and suggestions
through brochures and information on their websites.&nbsp; I will discuss my ideas, which
have been developed to a great extent from visiting websites with information on bears and
by reading brochures and books on the subject (such as <u>Bear Encounters, Their Causes
and Avoidance</u> by Stephen Herrero<u>)</u>. I have also spent a lot of time hiking and
camping in Grizzly Country and thinking about bears.</p>

<!--mstheme--><font face="book antiqua, times new roman, times">

<p align="left"><font size="3">A few years ago it was rather rare to see anyone carrying
pepper spray in Glacier National Park or Yellowstone while hiking or backpacking.&nbsp;
Today, I do carry pepper spray.&nbsp; Many other people also carry it.&nbsp; Pepper spray
manufactured specifically for use against bears is the only type of spray I would consider
carrying in Bear Country--large can, proper concentration of the active ingredients
(capsaicin and related capsaicinoids ingredient).&nbsp; I would not consider carrying a
smaller can or a product made for self defense against dogs or humans. </font></p>

<p align="left">The use of pepper spray as a defense against a grizzly bear attack may
prevent me from being seriously injured and may prevent a grizzly bear from being
destroyed.&nbsp; After much consideration, I have decided to carry it and be prepared to
use it.&nbsp; I would also use it if I were attacked by a mountain lion, and I would use
it to repel a predatory attack by a grizzly bear or a black bear.&nbsp; I have hiked a lot
of miles in grizzly country without pepper spray.&nbsp; I don't plan to go into the woods
thinking:&nbsp; <em>If I run into a grizzly bear, I don't have to worry because I carry
pepper spray</em>.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">There are documented cases of pepper spray repelling charging grizzly
bears without injury to the human.&nbsp; There are also cases where the user of pepper
spray was&nbsp; injured.&nbsp; Without knowing the specifics of an encounter where pepper
spray was used, it is impossible to determine why injury may have occurred.&nbsp; Was the
proper product used--large can, made for defense against bears?&nbsp; Had the effective
date for use of the product passed?&nbsp; Was the bear hit with the spray?&nbsp; Was the
bear sprayed directly in the face?&nbsp; At what distance?&nbsp; More and more data are
becoming available from incidents involving the use of pepper spray to repel charges by
bears.&nbsp; The reports I have read, including results recently published by Stephen
Herrero, are generally positive. &nbsp;Tests are being conducted under varying
conditions--wind conditions, rain, size of the can, delivery pattern of the spray,
distance to target, loss of potency of the pepper spray (shelf life), and other variables
may determine the effectiveness on a charging grizzly bear.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">Here are links with more information about Bear Pepper Spray--two web
sites of manufacturers of pepper spray and the Yellowstone Ecosystem Subcommittee of the
Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee position paper on the subject:</p>

<p align="left">Some pepper sprays may be marketed as &quot;bear spray&quot; or &quot;bear
repellent&quot; that are not made specifically for use against an attacking grizzly
bear.&nbsp; The differences may be in the size of the can, the concentration of the
effective ingredient, and the delivery system. &nbsp; The concentration of capsaicin must
be strong enough to have the desired effect on the bear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The delivery
system must be capable of delivering the spray with sufficient force and suspension; in
other words not fall at my feet when it comes out of the can.</p>

<p align="left">I carry the spray where I can get to it immediately--in a holster on my
hip. Carrying it in a chest holster is also an option.&nbsp; It won't do any good if it's
in my pack. &nbsp; There is (or should be) a date on the can, probably on the bottom which
may be a date the spray was manufactured. I believe Counter Assault and UDAP recommend
replacing the spray after three years.</p>

<!--mstheme--><font face="book antiqua, times new roman, times">

<p align="left">There are no guarantees for safety when I enter Grizzly Country.&nbsp; I
must accept the risk, realizing that I am entering the grizzly bear's home.&nbsp; Grizzly
habitat is shrinking.&nbsp; They have only a few &quot;sanctuaries&quot; left in the lower
48 states where they are somewhat protected--Grizzly Bear Recovery Zones.&nbsp; Each year
millions of people invade Glacier National Park, Yellowstone, and other parts of Grizzly
Country.&nbsp; The fact that very few incidents occur between grizzlies and humans is a
testament to the grizzly's ability to cope with humans.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following
discussion represents some of my ideas on how I try to avoid encounters and how to deal
with encounters and attacks should they occur.&nbsp; Considering the number of visitors to
Grizzly Country, few ever see a grizzly bear, much less get attacked by one. </p>

<p align="left">In addition to concerns for personal safety, <strong>encounters between
grizzly bears and humans have serious implications for the grizzly.&nbsp; Grizzly bears
that have conflicts with humans and are declared a nuisance may be removed from the
population.&nbsp; </strong>The <a
href="file:///C:/My%20Documents/American%20Grizzly%20Bear/interagency_grizzly_bear_guideli.htm">Interagency
Grizzly Bear Guidelines</a> address management actions to be taken when grizzly bears have
&quot;conflicts with humans.&quot;<strong>&nbsp; </strong>Removal of any grizzly bear from
an already threatened population, reduces chances for recovery to a healthy status and
ultimately removal from the Endangered Species List.&nbsp; The ability to some day make
realistic projections for long-term survival of the species depends on protecting
grizzlies and protecting the habitat they need to survive.&nbsp; Be mindful of the
consequences for humans <strong><u>and grizzlies</u></strong> when encounters occur.&nbsp;

<p align="left"><strong>I am not an expert on grizzly bear encounters and attacks.&nbsp; I
do not offer any of this information as advice on how to avoid encounters and attacks or
how to deal with encounters and attacks</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is simply information on
how I think about grizzly bear encounters and attacks. It has been developed by reading,
watching films, and and spending a lot of time hiking and camping in bear country.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">All grizzly bears don't run away when they encounter humans.&nbsp; Each
situation is different.&nbsp; In Glacier I encountered a grizzly bear on a trail at close
range--thirty feet.&nbsp; The grizzly was sitting, facing away from me&nbsp; The bear got
up, ran into the woods away from me, and let out a tremendous roar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
outcome may have been different if the grizzly had been facing me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">In 1997 in a backcountry campsite in Glacier, a&nbsp; bear came into camp
while I was packing to leave after cooking a breakfast of instant oatmeal and instant
coffee a little earlier.&nbsp; My wife came down the trail and started telling me
something about a bear.&nbsp; I turned to find a&nbsp; bear staring at me from a distance
of about 30 or 40 feet.&nbsp; The bear was standing in some grass at the edge of the lake.
&nbsp; I was looking at him/her head on.&nbsp; At first sight, my heart skipped a beat,
mainly because of the color, which was brown. &nbsp;But that bear was a cinnamon black
bear, the first of that color I had ever seen. I recognized that it was a black bear and
not a grizzly mainly by the shape of the face and big ears.&nbsp; When I recognized that
it was a black bear, I began hollering, waving my arms, and threw a rock behind as the
bear began to slowly move away--I would not have taken any of these actions if it had been
a grizzly. I don't know if the bear was attracted by the cooking odors I had recently
created.&nbsp; The bear was likely habituated to this campsite--I later learned from a
ranger hikers had picked up fish guts and a chunk of cheese near the edge of the lake the
day before.&nbsp; Due to no fault of its own, that beautiful black bear may no longer be a
resident of Glacier National Park or any other place.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is likely that bear
has been destroyed.&nbsp; </p>

<!--mstheme--><font face="book antiqua, times new roman, times">

<p>July 14, 1998</p>

<p><font size="3">My wife and I have just returned from a week of backpacking in Glacier
National Park, Montana.&nbsp; A young black bear was shot and killed on July 3, 1998, in
one of the backcountry campsites after getting human food that was left unattended for a
few minutes.&nbsp; The bear also got other food that was hung but not out of reach.&nbsp;
Park Rangers spent three nights trying to haze the bear away from the campground by firing
bean bags at him and using other means.&nbsp; The final straw came when he got into
cookware that was left on the ground while campers took a day hike.&nbsp; We witnessed
other inexcusable careless food-handling practices that may lead to the destruction of
other black bears and/or grizzly bears--other cookware and food left unattended or
improperly stored (including by a commercial guide service), food and garbage disposed in
campsites and food preparation areas, feeding wildlife.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Food and other items with odors must be properly stored and hung out of
reach of bears <strong><u>at all times</u></strong> when not in use, including cookware
that had been washed.&nbsp; Trash and food waste must be packed out.&nbsp; After receiving
a $50 fine for leaving their cookware unattended we witnessed one of these same campers
toss onion peels into the weeds at a food preparation area at another campsite.&nbsp; This
individual is an educated man, a Yale Man, working for the Federal Reserve Board in
Washington D.C.&nbsp; Ignorance is one thing, stupidity is another.&nbsp; I later talked
to the Park Ranger who killed the young black bear--he said it was one of the hardest
things he had ever had to do.&nbsp; It is true that &quot;A Fed Bear Is A Dead
Bear.&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Grizzly bears and black bears that become habituated to humans and their
food are very likely to be destroyed.&nbsp; Habituation occurs due to carelessness by
visitors to bear country and residents living in bear country.&nbsp; There are also cases
of people intentionally feeding bears and other wildlife and reports of a wildlife
photographer intentionally baiting bears on his property to obtain close-up photographs of
grizzly bears--watch for them in your favorite wildlife or outdoor magazine</font><font

&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I hiking into the wind or with the wind?&nbsp; Grizzly bears don't have
particularly great hearing or vision, but they can &quot;smell me from a mile away&quot;
and more if wind conditions are right.&nbsp; Look for fresh signs on the trail--scat
(grizzly droppings are large), digs (grizzlies can dig up enough earth to make it look
like a backhoe was at work, but their work can also be more subtle when digging tasty and
nutritious roots of plants), rubs (they love to scratch against trees and will leave hair
as a sign that they were present), tracks (typically, grizzly tracks are larger than a
black bear, with a much more evident claw impression).&nbsp; Watch and smell for
carcasses.&nbsp; <strong>Never approach a carcass</strong>.&nbsp; If I see a carcass, or
indications of a buried carcass, I must use extreme caution.&nbsp; Grizzly bears may stay
in the vicinity of a carcass and feed on it for several days.&nbsp; I would&nbsp; not go

    If improper food handling and storage practices are observed, don't hesitate&nbsp; to

    wilderness areas backcountry camping is less regulated and you can choose a good site away

    was closed last spring because there was a carcass nearby.&nbsp; If the park service is
    aware of the situation, they will close the site.&nbsp; Even if I had been assigned that
    site, I would not have stayed there--the smell is reason enough.&nbsp; The backcountry
    permit system in national parks is very restrictive as to where one may camp and for how
    long, but backpackers are not expected to place themselves in danger because of
    circumstances beyond their control.&nbsp; If conditions appear unsafe, move on to another

<p align="left">The grizzly may have decided on a plan for dealing with me and is now
putting it into action.&nbsp; However, my response may alter that plan.&nbsp; Here are the
possibilities I think about:&nbsp; If a grizzly charges me after first assessing the
situation and I run, I would expect to be attacked.&nbsp; If a grizzly charges and I hold
my ground, I believe the outcome is uncertain.&nbsp; There may be one or more charges
without contact, possibly several of them and possibly to within a few feet, and then the
grizzly may decide to go away.&nbsp; There may be one or more charges without contact, and
then an attack may ensue.&nbsp; There may be one charge and an immediate attack.
&nbsp;Other than holding my ground during a charge, what else might I do?&nbsp; There is
one more option--fire the pepper spray at the charging grizzly.&nbsp; Counter Assault
advertises for their 12 ounce canister:&nbsp; <em><font size="3">SPRAYS 18-35
FEET--CONTAINS 10 -12 BLASTS--EMPTIES IN 6-8 SECOND. </font></em></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">I would fire the first blast at a distance within the
effective range of the spray--maybe 25 feet.&nbsp; If the grizzly did not break off the
charge I would continue firing, aiming directly for the face.&nbsp; Keep in mind that a
grizzly bear might cover a distance of fifty yards in about three seconds.&nbsp; At that
rate, a grizzly would cover 30 feet in less than one second--like humans, some grizzly
bears run the 50 yard dash faster than others.&nbsp; Also keep in mind, all charges do not
result in attack, physical contact.&nbsp; Many charges are broken off at the last instant.

color="#91622f">Tree Climbing Is Not An Option I Would Consider In Most Situations</font><!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<!--mstheme--><font face="book antiqua, times new roman, times">

<p align="left">Regarding climbing trees--It has been widely reported that grizzlies other
than cubs can't or don't climb trees.&nbsp; While it is true that black bears are more
adapted to climbing, grizzlies may employ a combination of climbing, pulling, and reaching
to advance up a tree to reach an object--including a human.&nbsp; Grizzly bears are highly
intelligent and adaptive. &nbsp;Their abilities should not be under-estimated.&nbsp; A
grizzly bear can cover 50 yards in about 3 seconds.&nbsp; Before taking off for a tree, I
would have to consider the distance between the grizzly and myself and the distance to the
nearest climbable tree that I could climb to a safe height.&nbsp; If I were to take off
running for a tree, the grizzly may charge and initiate an attack.&nbsp; Once I start
climbing how high do I need to go?&nbsp; I once read that a person should climb at least
33 feet because a grizzly bear has been known to climb to slightly less than 33 feet
during an attack.&nbsp; Of course, how high depends on the particular grizzly I may be
climbing against.&nbsp; Do I drop my pack to make climbing easier?&nbsp; If I do and don't
make it, I won't have the pack for protection during an attack.&nbsp; There may be
instances when climbing a tree is an appropriate response--such as sighting a bear at a
distance that would allow time to find a suitable tree and climb to a safe height. &nbsp;
That is a judgement call I would have to make depending on the circumstances. &nbsp;
Depending on what the grizzly might be doing, I might have to sit in the tree for quite a
while.&nbsp; In a case like that backtracking, detouring, or staying on the ground and
waiting for the grizzly to move out of the area might also be options.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left"><strong>Remember</strong>, grizzly bear behavior and reaction to an
encounter are not totally predictable, but the outcome will likely be highly dependent on
the reaction and behavior of the person or persons involved.&nbsp; Try to remain calm--<strong>most
encounters end without injury</strong>.&nbsp; Grizzlies often&nbsp; charge without
initiating contact, possibly veering off at the last split-second before contact. &nbsp;
Any conflict between a grizzly bear and humans, even if no injury is associated, may
result in the grizzly being declared a nuisance and being &quot;removed&quot; from the
population. &nbsp;Removed typically means destroyed, killed.&nbsp; The Interagency Grizzly
Bear Guidelines are used by managers to determine the control action to be taken after a
conflict with humans occurs.&nbsp; For more information on the guidelines go to <a

<!--mstheme--><font face="book antiqua, times new roman, times">

<p align="left">This strategy for dealing with an attack is known as playing dead. &nbsp;
Injuries are almost certain to occur during any grizzly bear attack; the idea is to be
subjected to lesser injuries than are likely to occur by trying to run or by trying to
fight back.&nbsp; I have read and heard of attacks in which the person being attacked
moved too quickly after the initial attack and was attacked a second time with much
greater injuries being administered by the grizzly.&nbsp; A grizzly bear that attacks a
human likely does so because the human is perceived as a threat.&nbsp; If the grizzly
attacks and then stops the attack, the victim is no longer perceived to be a threat.
&nbsp;Movement is again perceived as a threatening action.&nbsp; Give the bear time to
move away before moving or getting up.&nbsp; Predatory attacks are different and require a
totally different strategy--I would not play dead if subjected to a predatory attack (see
below).</p>

<p>Again,<strong> I do not offer any of this information as advice on how to avoid
encounters and attacks or how to deal with encounters and attacks</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;For
a detailed discussion, with many case studies and data, read Stephen Herrero's book, <em>Bear
Attacks, Their Causes and Avoidance.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another book on the subject, <em>Backcountry
Bear Basics</em>,&nbsp;was published in 1997 by the Mountaineers.&nbsp; Many other books
on the subject are available.&nbsp; Read more than one book.&nbsp; Reading on the subject
helps me feel more confident that I can handle an encounter with a grizzly should one
occur.&nbsp; I don't rely solely on what I read in a book.&nbsp; I think about grizzly
bear encounters a lot.&nbsp; Others may offer &quot;advice&quot; on how to deal with
grizzly bear encounters and attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am responsible for my own safety.
&nbsp; If I am injured by a grizzly bear, it is my fault--not the grizzly bear's fault and
not the fault of the author of some book I read on how to avoid an encounter.&nbsp; There
are no guarantees.&nbsp; I am not terrified of flying in airplanes, but I am occasionally
a little uncomfortable--I have no control of the airplane.&nbsp; Hiking and camping in
Grizzly Country are not like that--I have a lot of control.&nbsp; Grizzly bear encounters
and attacks are extremely rare, but they do happen.&nbsp; I accept the risk.

<p align="left">I define predatory attack as:&nbsp; An attack by a grizzly bear or black
bear where the bear has intentions of making a meal of me.&nbsp; If a bear had been
stalking me and then attacked, I would consider that a predatory attack.&nbsp; If a bear
attacked me in my tent, I would consider that a predatory attack.&nbsp; Some advise that
any attack by a black bear should be considered a predatory attack.&nbsp; I don't accept
that <font size="3">assumption.&nbsp; I believe there may be cases where a black bear may
attack in a defensive mode, such as a surprise encounter on a trail at close range
(particularly if a sow with cubs are involved.&nbsp; </font></p>

    and other possible situations.&nbsp; A recent newspaper article reported that some people
    had used pepper spray as a &quot;bear repellent,&quot; applying it to the skin, like
    mosquito repellent.&nbsp; The can I have warns against contact with skin.&nbsp; Others are
    known to have sprayed it around the perimeter of their tent to set up an invisible
    barrier, ensuring a safe night's sleep.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; The use of pepper spray in
    these ways may actually attract bears, a food-like odor. &nbsp; I believe in the
    application of a little common sense in the use of any such powerful irritant.
    &nbsp;Absent that, always read the directions.&nbsp; For more detail about the use and
