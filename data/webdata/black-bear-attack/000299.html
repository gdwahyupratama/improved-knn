Subject: Re: Fatal Bear Attack In Great Smokey Mountain National Park

To clear up some misinformation ...

According to Park Service trackers, what probably happened was the sow
and her cub came across the woman while she was laying down, maybe
napping.  They made contact, and then the woman got up and ran a short
distance.  The sow caught her and brought her down.  She got up again,
and was cornered by the two bears when the fatality occurred.

Her daypack was untouched.  The bears were not large.  The sow weighed
112 lbs and the yearling weighed 40.  The average summer weight of a sow
in the Park is about 175, but 150 is pretty much expected in May.  This
particular sow had three cubs heading into last winter, but was down to
one this spring.  The fall acorn crop was poor and a lot of bears went
into den underweight.  However, many bears starve to death in the Park,
and there has never been a case of human predation before in the entire
southeast.

People have reported that the bear's posturing over the body was proof
of predation.  I am not an expert on black bear predation, but I will
say that when a bear gets a hold of a backpack, it claims it.  It is a
very foolish and difficult task to retrieve a backpack from a black bear
once it begins eating the contents.  From what I heard about the
behavior of the animals while they were trying to recover the body, it
is in line with the behavior I have seen surrounding a claimed pack.

Outside of the loss to the family and community for this very respected
teacher, one of the most disturbing aspects of this is that by all
indications, this was a truly wild and natural bear.  We are all taught
that in its wild and natural state, a black bear associates human beings
with death, destruction and all things bad.  When made aware of the
presence of humans, a black bear will leave the area.  Normally what is
required to alter this behavior, is for the animal to be corrupted by
exposure to human food or garbage.  After a few positive experiences,
they begin to associate humans with food and lose there fear.  This is
when they usually become a nuisance and pose a danger to people and
property.  Once a bear gets habituated to human food in the Park, their
life expectancy drops to less than a year.

Historically, however, somewhere around 90% of black bear caused
fatalities are from animals completely in their wild and natural state. 
In fact, when it comes to fatalities, it seems that lack of experience
with human beings is a bigger contributor; they simply do not know what
dangerous animals humans are.

Does this incident mark a change in black bear behavior to human
beings?  No.  With somewhere between 500,000 and 750,000 black bears in
North America, and at least 350,000,000 humans, fatal black bear attacks
are still one of the rarest events in nature.  In recorded history,
there have only been a total of 43 fatal black bear attacks in all of
North America.  In the Great Smoky Mountains NP alone, we get 10 million
people a year coming through an 800 square mile area with a black bear
population of over 1,800 animals.  Feeding bears food from their hands,
chasing cubs through the woods with video cameras, mobs surrounding
trees a family of bears has taken refuge in, restaurants baiting bears
for the viewing pleasure of their guests ... these are just some
examples of ridiculous behavior that takes place every year with
surprisingly little cost in human lives.

Do we need to change our behavior towards black bears?  No.  Black bears
demand respect, but not fear from backcountry users.  While in the
backcountry we are visiting their home.  Taking proper precautions with
food, enjoying sightings of these animals from a respectful distance,
leaving bear cubs alone, these things will continue to provide safe
enjoyable backcountry experiences for millions of users.  Please do not
take firearms into the Great Smoky Mountains NP.  It is against the law,
and you will be bringing in a real danger to battle imaginary ones.  If
you are too concerned to feel safe in the Park without a gun, you
probably do not need to be there.

The ongoing rumors concerning foul play stem from three sources: 1. The
fact that a fatal black bear attack had never before occurred in the
Southeast. 2. The fact that the woman was out with her ex-husband (in
the process of reconciling). 3. The long time interval between initial
contact and contacting the Park Service.  These rumors will persist for
at least a couple more months; on Friday the coroner announced he will
not release any preliminary findings from the victim's autopsy until the
final report is completed 2 to 3 months from now.

A committee of Park Service employees, the trackers, and bear experts
from around the country will study the results from the woman's autopsy,
the bear's necropsy, and the tracker's report to produce a final report
on the incident later this year.
