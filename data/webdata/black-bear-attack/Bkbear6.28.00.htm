UPDATE ON BLACK BEAR ATTACK IN TWO MEDICINE VALLEY...<BR>
PARK OFFICIALS TO DESTROY BEAR 
<P>
WEST GLACIER, MONT.-- Glacier National Park rangers continue to search for
the black bear that attacked and injured a hiker in the Two Medicine Valley
on Monday, June 26, 2000. Because of the bear's aggressive behavior towards
humans, it will be destroyed when located, in accordance with the guidelines
of the park's Bear Management Plan. 
<P>
Jason Sansom, 24, of Malstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls, Montana suffered
puncture wounds to both arms after an unprovoked attack by a brown-colored
black bear on the south shore trail of Two Medicine Lake on Monday afternoon.
Sansom and his wife had been on a day hike when the incident occurred. His
wife was not injured. 
<P>
Park Rangers, with assistance from a paramedic with the boat concessionaire,
responded to the scene and stabilized Sansom. He was later transported to
Browning Hospital where his wounds were treated. He was released later that
night.
<P>
Sansom was able to take two photographs of the bear before he was attacked,
which later helped park officials in confirming the bear's identity as the
same one that had precipitated a temporary closure of the Two Medicine Campground
earlier this summer on June 13. In that instance, the bear had shown no fear
of humans and resisted attempts by park rangers to haze it away from the
area. In addition, numerous hikers reported seeing the bear along the south
shore trail earlier in the day near the area where Sansom was attacked. The
bear again displayed no apparent fear of humans. 
<P>
Glacier National Park's Bear Management Guidelines state that a black bear
having received human food or garbage, displaying conditioned behavior to
humans, causing property damage, and acting overly familiar with humans will
be removed and/or destroyed.
<P>
The goal of Glacier National Park's bear management policy is to ensure a
natural and free-ranging population of grizzly and black bears. Because the
bear had exhibited aggressive behavior towards humans, trapping and relocating
the bear was not an option. 
<P>
<P>
The south shore trail along Two Medicine Lake remains closed as park rangers
continue to search for the bear. Baited culvert traps will also be set in
the Two Medicine area to try and attract the bear. 
<P>
<P>
Since this area is near the Blackfeet Reservation, park officials are working
closely with Tribal Fish and Wildlife employees to locate and remove the
bear.
<P>
<P>
Due to the bear's aggressive behavior towards humans, Two Medicine Campground
is restricted to hard-side campers only (no tents). This restriction will
be in effect until the bear is located and destroyed.
<P>
<P>
Black bear encounters that cause injury to humans are not common in Glacier
National Park. The last incident occurred in 1978, at Trout Lake, in the
Camas Creek drainage, when a camper was bit while in his sleeping bag, receiving
puncture wounds to his arms and shoulders. The park has never had a fatality
associated with a black bear.
<P>
<P>
Once again, park officials remind visitors that all bears can be dangerous
and should NOT be approached under ANY circumstances. Hikers are urged to
familiarize themselves with recommended safety precautions while they are
in bear country such as, carrying bear spray, making loud noise when hiking,
only hiking during broad daylight, and never hiking alone.
