 <p>It is, simply, an IP world. The campus network is an IP network. The
focus of the next-generation national and regional networks is on IP. 
Production-quality applications software for video and voice will emerge
using IP multicast and IP bandwidth allocation as their enablers. 

 <p>We need a campus-network transmission system that routes and delivers
IP packets at high speed and with low latency between server and desktop
devices on Ethernet transmission systems interconnected by devices that
facilitate the integration of IP routing and Ethernet switching. That same
transmission system must also continue to carry non-IP traffic between
Ethernet-connected devices (eg, for Appletalk and a Watstar virtual
backbone).

 <p>We must strive to achieve the optimum balance of the following ...

 <p><center><table width="90%">
 <tr valign=top><th align=right>affordability<td>Avoid spending more or
sooner than is warranted. 
 <tr valign=top><th align=right>extendibility<td>Avoid choices that will
preclude the ability to pursue alternatives that may become important in
the future. 
 <tr valign=top><th align=right>longevity<td>Secure management approval to
fund for on-going evolution in subsequent years. 
 <tr valign=top><th align=right>measurability<td>Extend the centralized
measurement of traffic loading and the projection of traffic growth all
the way out to the workgroup-switch ports, rather than just the backbone
ports.
 <tr valign=top><th align=right>scalability<td>Over-design. Avoid choices
that leave inadequate room for growth.
 <tr valign=top><th align=right>simplicity<td>Avoid choices that can be
avoided.
 <tr valign=top><th align=right>survivability<td>Avoid single points of
failure.
 <tr valign=top><th align=right>vendor alliance<td>Choose one single
vendor that has all of the necessary transmission, switching, and routing
products and has established long-term marketplace leadership.
