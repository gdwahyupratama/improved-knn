<h3>The ONet network ... province, to country and world</h3>
 <p>One of the objectives for the UW campus network is that it be <i>well
connected</i> to the external communities that are of greatest interest to
UW. Membership in the provincial <a href="http://www.onet.on.ca/">ONet
Networking</a> corporation is providing that connectivity for UW at the
provincial, national, and international levels. The ONet network is
connected to a number of national networks in Canada, each of also which
provides international connections to the US and other countries, which in
turn have connections to national networks in additional countries.
 <ul>
 <li>For <b>general-Internet</b> traffic, the ONet network has multi-homed
connections in Toronto and Ottawa to several Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) with national and international connectivity.</li>
 <li>For <b>university-communities</b> traffic, the ONet network includes
connections in Toronto and Ottawa to CANARIE's <a href="http://www.canarie.ca/advnet/canet3.html">CA*net3</a> "optical IP"
national advanced-Internet backbone, which connects the ONet-like
provincial networks and has connections to advanced-Internet networks like
CA*net3 in other countries.</li>
 </ul>
 The university-communities connection carries all traffic to and from
most of the other universities and colleges in Ontario, and, via CA*net3,
the universities in the rest of Canada and the many universities in the US
and in other countries that have "advanced Internet" networks like
CA*net3. The general-Internet connection carries everything else (see <a href="Stats/extvol.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/Stats/extvol.html">external-volume statistics</a>).</p>

<h3>Local ISPs ... city, region</h3>
 <p>There is currently no local-community "point of presence" for the
direct interconnection of the networks operated by the various ISPs that
provide connectivity for the community's residents, businesses, and
public-sector entities. Until then, the UW campus network is providing
temporary <a href="local.html" webstripperlinkwas="local.html">local-community connectivity</a> with
interested local ISPs.</p>

<h3>ORION ... province, to country and world</h3>
 <p>Within Ontario, the initiative is underway to create a multi-gigabit
"Optical IP" provincial backbone network that will interconnect the
province's universities, colleges, schools, research, and related
organizations in each of 21 areas, with a link from ORION to CA*net3.
 <ul>
 <li>2000-02 ... the Ministry of Energy, Science, and Technology (MEST)
issued an RFP. A response was submitted by "the ORANO Group" (the ONet
Networking corporation and four municipal/regional network organizations,
with ONet Networking as the lead partner).</li>
 <li>2000-05 ... MEST announced "funding of up to $57M" for the <a href="http://www.est.gov.on.ca/english/ar/nr_intro.cfm?news_id=175&body=yes">Ontario
Research and Innovation Optical Network</a>, with the ORANO Group as its
partner for <a href="http://www.est.gov.on.ca/english/ar/nr_intro.cfm?backgrounder_id=190&back=yes">
phase-one deployment</a>, with network operations to be managed by ONet
Networking for the first two years.</li>
 <li>2000-10 ... Unfortunately, MEST had allocated only $3.5M to phase
one, which was not nearly enough, so a refined proposal was submitted by
the ORANO Group.</li>
 <li>2001-12 ... MEST announced that it had created a non-profit "ORANO"
corporation to receive and manage the MEST funds and govern all matters
pertaining to the ORION network. The ORANO corporation issued a "Statement
of Work Guide" on 2001-12-20 describing the two-part process by which the
ORION-eligible institutions in each of the 21 areas were to propose the
location of their area's ORION point-of-presence (PoP) by 2002-01-18 and
their expected costs in connecting to that ORION PoP by 2002-03-15.</li>
 <li>2002-?? ... ORION will provide UW with a 1Gbps Ethernet interface for
"university communities" connectivity.</li>
 </ul>

<h3>A Waterloo-area network exchange point ... city, region</h3>
 <p>From time to time there has been a lot of apparent interest in
creating an open-to-all IP "backbone" network to interconnect the internal
networks of the private- and public-sector organizations and the
residential-service ISPs in the area. Here's a summary of what has, so
far, failed to materialize in the region.
 <ul>
 <li>1994-06 ... Discussions began for the creation of a municipal network
to interconnect the internal networks of both private- and public-sector
organizations in the KW/Cambridge/Guelph area (designated by the Ontario
government as "Canada's Technology Triangle"). In August of 1995, a <a href="CTT/rfi.html" webstripperlinkwas="CTT/rfi.html">Request For Information</a> document was issued to
potential suppliers/operators. At that time, the number of potential
participant organizations was about fifty. By December of 1995, as a
consequence of pricing estimates in responses received to the RFI, only
thirteen of those were willing to commit to a phase-one implementation. In
May of 1996, final negotiations were underway with Bell Advanced
Communications to prepare a letter of intent and a <a href="CTT/service.html" webstripperlinkwas="CTT/service.html">service agreement</a> for an initial network
configuration to be in operation before September 1996. In the summer of
1996, one of the larger participants withdrew and the remaining
participants could not afford to proceed, and the project fell into a
state of limbo and disinterest.</li>
 <li>1997-10 ... Interest in a municipal-area network was renewed by the
<a href="http://www.communitech.org/">Communitech</a> association, the <a href="http://www.city.waterloo.on.ca/">City of Waterloo</a>, and the <a href="http://www.region.waterloo.on.ca/">Region of Waterloo</a>, with a
focus on obtaining local and federal funding to help meet the needs of the
municipal government, public-sector agencies, and high-tech companies in
the area. Some of this renewed interest focused on using part of a
proposed business-park development on UW's north-campus land to create
world-class networked facilities for the area's high-tech companies, but
there was not sufficient commitment to proceed.</li>
 <li>1999-02 ... The introduction of the federal government's <a href="http://smartcommunities.ic.gc.ca/">Smart Communities</a> program
created renewed hope for a municipal network when this area's submission
became one of five on the shortlist from which Ontario's "demonstration
project" would be selected. But in 2000-05 that honour went to the Ottawa
"Smart Capital" project.</li>
 <li>2000-03 ... the Government of Ontario introduced its counterpart <a href="http://www.est.gov.on.ca/connect/index.htm">Connect Ontario</a>
program to help fund up to 50 Ontario "smart" communities. As of 2001-07,
three Ontario communities have been awarded funds to help with the
implementation of their proposed projects and another sixteen communities
have been awarded funds to help develop the business plans for their
submissions.</li>
 </ul>

<h3>WREPNet</h3>
 <p>The <a href="http://www.wrepnet.on.ca/">Waterloo Region Education and
Public Network</a> is a private regional network servicing the multiple
locations of the Waterloo Catholic District School Board, the Waterloo
Region District School Board, the Region of Waterloo, the city of
Waterloo, the city of Kitchener, the city of Cambridge, the Waterloo
Public Library, the Kitchener Public Library, the Cambridge Public Library,
and Conestoga College. Planning began in 1998 when the two District School
Boards applied for $10M from Ontario's Ministry of Education and Training
to create a regional network to connect their respective locations
throughout Waterloo, Kitchener, Cambridge, and the surrounding areas.
According to statements made at its 2001-06-01 "public launch" ceremony at
Kitchener City Hall, WREPNet uses 550km of fibre leased from <a href="http://www.fibretech.net/">FibreTech</a> and 3Com switching/routing
devices to interconnect the internal networks at each of 217 locations,
encompassing more than 14,000 computers.</p>
 <p>UW is not a participant in WREPNet, although that certainly would be
an option to evaluate if UW had multiple campuses in the Region.</p>
