<h1>UWng RFP process</h1>
<p>1997-08-17
</div>

 <p>An RFP was sent 1997-06-06 by Purchasing to seven major
Internet-technologies vendors and to the online-notice Ontario/Quebec
procurement system. In summary, the <a href=rfp199706.html webstripperlinkwas=rfp199706.html>RFP</a> stated:
 <blockquote>
 <p>University of Waterloo is seeking to form a long-term strategic
relationship with a major vendor of switching, routing, and network-server
products for the establishment and evolution of its "next-generation
Internet" campus network to interoperate with the ONet "UNI*net" and
CANARIE "CA*net-II" regional and national networks. 
 <p>The technologies to enable this next-generation campus network will
centre around the integration of Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet
switching with IP routing and IP multicast and IP bandwidth reservation
and quality-of-service, and will extend to include servers for related network services
such as address-assignment control, network-access device and user
authentication, Internet and Intranet firewalls, secure Web-based
commerce, computer-telephony integration, and desktop/classroom
videoconferencing and distance education.
 </blockquote>
 <p>Submissions were received from three vendors and a
reseller/integrator. The submissions were reviewed by IST and CNAG. 

 <ul> 
 <p><li>The reseller/integrator was eliminated immediately because it was
not a vendor, and therefore not an entity with which we could form a
strategic vendor relationship. The three vendors were invited to give
technical presentations to IST and CNAG. 
 <p><li>Vendor A presented excellent transmission-layer products with an
impressive Ethernet switching-architecture technology. Unfortunately, its
architechure was layer-two only, with no support for network-layer
routing. With no network-layer architecture or products and no
network-servers products, vendor A did not meet the full range of
requirements of the RFP. 
 <p><li>Vendor B strongly and repeatedly emphasized its focus on the ATM
transmission-systems world. It stated that it did not intend to pursue the
integration of IP routing and Ethernet switching and that it did not
intend to place substantial emphasis on Gigabit Ethernet. Vendor B did not
meet the full range of requirements of the RFP. 
 <p><li>Cisco was the only respondent with products and plans and
marketplace presence that met the full range of requirements of the RFP.
 </ul>

 <p>The RFP was awarded to Cisco. In his 1997-08-06 announcement to UCIST
and CNAG, Jay Black (Associate Provost, IST) stated: 
 <blockquote>
 <p>The following factors influenced my decision. First, I believe that
a strategic alliance with a single vendor indeed has some value to UW at
this time; accepting the [vendor B] proposal would have implied dealing
with one or more other vendors. Second, although we may well require
ATM-based communication in the future, I do not believe that is the case
today; we can migrate towards that goal if and as it becomes more
compelling. Third, I don't believe that IST has enough spare capacity to
do anything that isn't necessary today.
