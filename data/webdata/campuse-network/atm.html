<h1>On the matter of ATM</h1>
<p>1998-11-16
</div>

 <p>The evolution of Ethernet that started with the emergence of the
Ethernet switch has eliminated ATM as a required campus
transmission-system strategy. 

 <ul>
 <p><li>In 1997, there was no reason to believe that we would be replacing
UW's telephone system with some form of ATM-distributed phone system ... 
and now, major phone-system vendors (eg, Nortel) are looking to IP over
Gigabit Ethernet as the vehicle for the interconnection of their future
distributed-component telephony technologies. 

 <p><li>There is no reason to believe that we will need to provision for
native "broadcast-quality video" throughout the campus. Most of the
opportunity that exists is for videoconferencing traffic for distance-ed
applications, and that will be addressed by emerging IP-based "multicast" 
application software. 

 <p><li>For the moment, however, ATM is still required for the connection
of the campus network to the ONet network, although that will likely be
replaced by an IP/WDM base in a few years. ATM is also still used as a
backbone transmission system within the Faculty of Mathematics.
