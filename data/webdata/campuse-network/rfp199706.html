 <p align=right>June 4, 1997
 <p>University of Waterloo is seeking to form a long-term strategic
relationship with a major vendor of switching, routing, and network-server
products for the establishment and evolution of its "next-generation
Internet" campus network to interoperate with the ONet "UNI*net" and
CANARIE "CA*net-II" regional and national networks. 
 <p>The technologies to enable this next-generation campus network will
centre around the integration of Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet
switching with IP routing and IP multicast and IP bandwidth reservation
and QoS, and will extend to include servers for related network services
such as address-assignment control, network-access device and user
authentication, Internet and Intranet firewalls, secure Web-based
commerce, computer-telephony integration, and desktop/classroom
videoconferencing and distance education. 
 <p>Phase one of this project, to be in place for September 1997, requires
the deployment of high-capacity backbone and workgroup switching/routing
devices supporting Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, interswitch VLANs, and IP
multicast. The initial core of the network will be a Fast Ethernet
backbone of from eight to twelve fibre-connected
switching/routing/multicast modular devices, each of which provides from
12 to 48 Fast Ethernet fibre and/or copper links to fully-compatible
workgroup switching devices. A range of workgroup devices is required:
some workgroups will require from 24 to 48 10Mbps ports each capable of
supporting multiple devices and two or more 100Mbps ports for the fibre
uplink and for local UTP-connected workgroup-server devices; others will
require from 12 to 24 auto-sensing 10/100Mbps ports and a 100Mbps fibre-
uplink port. One of the core devices must also support multiple ATM links
(initially, two or more OC-3 ports and one or two T1 circuit-emulation
cards). The number of workgroup switches is expected to range from about
thirty to perhaps sixty over the duration of phase one. Phase two of the
project will extend the capacity of the network and will continue to
extend the number of workgroup switches.
 <p>The vendor will enter into some form of on-going "return for credit" 
agreement to upgrade/replace the phase-one devices to support
IEEE-standardized Gigabit Ethernet and interswitch VLANs once those
standards are finalized, to extend the use of ATM to whatever extent UW
perceives necessary, and to incorporate new function and devices or
modules as the vendor evolves its products so that the UW campus network
can continue to evolve in pace with the next-generation Internet
community.
 <p>Overview and background documents that were created to facilitate
UW-internal discussion are available in the "Next-generation network"
section of the UW Campus Networks webspace
(http://www.ist.uwaterloo.ca/cn/). Address questions to Roger Watt

<p>TOPOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS
 <p>The new backbone of the UW campus network will be a core of nine
nodes. We want sufficient multiple paths such that an outage of any one of
the nine will not prevent communication among the other eight.

<p>ROUTING CONSIDERATIONS
 <p>The UW campus network is primarily an IP network, but it also carries
some amount of AppleTalk and must continue to do so for the immediate
future.
 <p>The MC core node must be a full-function switching/routing node with
multiple Ethernet and multiple ATM links, including UW's external
connection (an 155Mbps ATM link to ONet Networking's K-W switching/routing
node, located in the same equipment room as UW's MC node). We currently
use an IP "default route" for the external link, but we may soon need to
move to some external routing protocol such as BGP4. The MC-node device
must include the ability to configure special ATM-layer external circuits,
and the ability to impose accept/deny "filtering" conditions on all IP
traffic to/from the external connection by a variety of controls including
IP addresses and IP/TCP/UDP protocol types. We currently capture and
report on counts of IP packets and bytes to/from the external connection,
and wish to continue to do so. 
 <p>The ideal is that layer-three traffic between any two links on one of
the nine core nodes does not have to leave that node. It may not be
essential that all other eight nodes have full routing functionality, but
to avoid single-point-of-failure, at least one other node must. The
pattern of traffic within the UW network dictates that that be the E2
node. For the other seven nodes, it may be sufficient that they obtain and
use routing information from the two full-function nodes. It will be a
significant asset if this same ability to learn and use routing
information can be extended out to the workgroup switches.

<p>ON THE MATTER OF ATM
 <p>In its production environment, UW intends to pursue voice and video
as IP-based applications, when and as the ability to do so matures within
the Internet community. While there is an interest in ATM-layer
connectivity in several research groups, UW has no immediate production
need to use ATM as the vehicle to interconnect these nine nodes, and it is
not clear whether the need to extend ATM to the other eight nodes will
arise within the remainder of this decade. However, special needs may
arise from time to time, and UW is not unwilling to consider an ATM core
today if the price is sufficiently compelling to outweigh the added
staff-impact costs of complexity. 

<p>IMPLEMENTATION TIMING AND MIGRATION
 <p>We need to have some of this in place by September 1997, but it will
be impossible to do the full implementation by then. We are unable to
commit to any given schedule other than one we will make up as we go,
driven only by our initial implementation successes and our need to deploy
new equipment and schedule cutovers so as to avoid substantive disruption
to the current production network.

<p>QUESTIONS, CONCERNS, etc
 <p>Please clarify the manner in which IP routing works between the
devices you are proposing. EXAMPLES. What IP route-advertisement protocols
does the device accept/advertise? How does a node that does not have full
routing functionality acquire information about routes and the loss of
routes? 
 <p>Please clarify the manner in which IP multicast works between the
devices you are proposing. EXAMPLES. How do the core nodes communicate
group-membership information out to the workgroup nodes?
 <p>Please comment on your ability to adapt to our schedule and your
ability to loan us equipment to assist in the transition from the old
network to the new network. EXAMPLES. Can you adjust to our need for
on-going assistance in planning a migration strategy? Can you loan us an
FDDI interface for the MC core node so that we can interconnect the
current backbone to the new backbone?
