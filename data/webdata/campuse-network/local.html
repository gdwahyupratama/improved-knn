<h1>UW campus network:<br>local-community connectivity</h1>
<p>Last updated 2001-12-22.

Initial version 1999-08-19.

<h2>Objective</h2>
 <p>One of the objectives for the UW campus network is that it be <i>well
connected</i> within the major UW-external communities that are of
interest to UW. At the provincial, national, and international levels,
UW's membership in the provincial <a href="http://www.onet.on.ca/">ONet
Networking</a> corporation currently provides that connectivity.</p>
 <p>However, there is currently no municipal/regional local-community
"point of presence" for the direct interconnection of the networks
operated by the major Internet Service Provider (ISP) companies that
provide connectivity for the community's residents, businesses, and
public-sector entities. In some extreme cases, those ISPs are not even
interconnected anywhere within Canada, and thus traffic between UW and the
local-community entities serviced by those ISPs travels to some
interconnection point in the US on one path, and back from the US into
Canada on another path, and is subject to poor transit times whenever any
link along the way is congested.</p>
 <p>Some of the businesses in the community are high-tech companies with
which UW faculty members conduct joint research activities, and some of
the residents of the community are UW students, faculty, and staff
interacting from home with computing-server facilities at UW. Therefore,
in 1999-08, UW's <a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/">IST</a> department
temporarily embarked on direct interconnections between the UW network and
the area's major ISPs, in order to improve the state of UW's connectivity
within the local community, until there is a broader alternative that will
benefit everyone (such as a <a href="http://www.est.gov.on.ca/English/Connect/index.htm">Connect
Ontario</a> municipal/regional network), to which IST could then connect
UW's campus network.</p>
 <p>Until then, the following are the terms under which IST is pursuing
temporary direct interconnections with local ISPs. Such connections
currently exist with:
 <ul>
 <li>1999-05-25:  <a href="http://www.sentex.net/">Sentex
Communications</a></li>
 <li>2001-12-18: <a href="http://www.fibretech.net/">FibreTech
Telecommunications</a></li>
 </ul>
 and IST is always willing to pursue discussion with others.
 </p>

<h2>General considerations</h2>
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>IST and {ISP} both see value in improving the path between those
members of the community who can benefit from a local connection of the UW
and the {ISP} networks, until such time as one or both of us sees a more
encompassing alternative.</li>
 <li>IST and {ISP} agree to create that connection at UW as an experiment
that we will keep in place for as long as we both agree that it continues
to be useful, that no money will change hands between us and that neither
UW nor {ISP} assumes any financial or other obligations on behalf of the
other.</li>
 <li>IST and {ISP} agree that we will each make our own reasonable efforts
in accordance with our own priorities to identify and resolve any
operational problems that might occur, that either of us can terminate the
experiment for any reason at any time, but that we will both attempt to
give the other party as much advance warning of that as we can.</li>
 <li>IST and {ISP} agree that neither will publicize the existence of the
interconnect except at a time and in a manner agreeable to both of
us.</li>
 </ul>
 </p>

<h2>Technical considerations</h2>
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>Unless there are compelling reasons otherwise, IST will provide a
port on one of the campus-network Ethernet switches as the demarcation
point, and will provide rack space (assumed to be less than one vertical
foot), power (assumed to be no more than that required by the average PC),
and UPS support for any {ISP}-owned network-interface device that will be
installed and thereafter supported by {ISP} as {ISP}'s side of the
demarcation point. {ISP} understands that IST's UPSes are to protect
against short-term power fluctuations, not to protect against
user-detectable power outages.</li>
 <li>{ISP} will work with IST's Manager of Communications Support to
coordinate the installation of the {ISP}-owned transmission link that will
terminate at the IST-specified demarcation point, and to arrange access to
{ISP}'s equipment as needed. {ISP} will be the "customer of record" for
that transmission link.</li>
 <li>{ISP} will work with IST's Manager of Network Systems Integration to
coordinate the exchange of routing information for the UW network and the
{ISP} network numbers that service its municipal/regional customers.</li>
 </ul>
 </p>

<h2>UW concerns</h2>
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li>IST is eager to consider extending the experiment to include other
major ISPs in the community that may be interested. However, IST cannot
justify the costs of any significant impact on UW resources in order to
accommodate a large number of interested ISPs. IST will therefore pursue
offers from other ISPs on a case-by-case basis in terms of the overall
benefit to the members of the UW community.</li>
 </ul>
