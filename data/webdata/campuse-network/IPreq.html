<h2><a name="assign">Requests for assignment</a></h2>
 <p>A request for the assignment of an IP subnet number or the assignment
of an IP address is to be mailed to <a href="mailto:hostmaster@cnoc.uwaterloo.ca">hostmaster</a> with the
complete information needed for registration as specified in the
appropriate section below. A request submitted by any person other than
the CNAG prepresentative responsible for the requestor's constituency will
be forwarded to the CNAG representative for confirmation before being
processed further. No device may be connected to the network until its IP
address has been assigned and registered.</p>

<h2><a name="subnet">Subnet registration</a></h2>
 <p>The following information about each IP subnet in the campus computer
network is recorded in the Domain Name System data.
<pre>
   name.net   IN A      129.97.subnetnumber.0
              IN HINFO  "parent_subnetname router_name" "protocol_type"
              IN TXT    "ORGUNIT unit,subunit,group"
              IN TXT    "ADMIN uwuserid"
              IN TXT    "CONTACT uwuserid"
              IN TXT    "LOCATION list of buildings"
              IN TXT    "DATE yyyy-mm-dd"
</pre></p>
 <p>There are various ways to derive the name that has been assigned to a
subnet number by using some form of "DNS query" utility. For example, for
subnet 128, a query for 129.97.128.0 will tell you that this is
"uw.net.uwaterloo.ca". A query to display all of the DNS entry for that
name will display the information shown above.</p>
 <p>The purpose of the TXT records is described below. A record for
ORGUNIT, ADMIN, or CONTACT is only included if the information for the
subnet is different than the information for the parent_subnet within
which the subnet is contained.</p>

<h2><a name="device">Device registration</a></h2>
 <p>In a similar fashion, information about each device in the campus
computer network is recorded in the Domain Name System data.
<pre>
   hostname   IN A      129.97.subnetnumber.hostnumber
              IN HINFO  "manufacturer model"  "operating_system_name"
              IN TXT    "ORGUNIT unit,subunit,group"
              IN TXT    "ADMIN identifier"
              IN TXT    "CONTACT identifier"
              IN TXT    "LOCATION bldg,room[,etc]"
              IN TXT    "DATE yyyy-mm-dd"
</pre></p>
 <p>A TXT record for ORGUNIT, ADMIN, or CONTACT is only included if the
information for the device is different than the information for the
subnet in which the device is contained.</p>
 <p>Example: a campus server
<pre>   
   watserv1   IN A      129.97.128.116
              IN HINFO  "Sun Sparc20"  "Solaris"
              IN TXT    "LOCATION MC,1061"
              IN TXT    "DATE 2001-08-15"
</pre></p>
 <p>Example: an individual's workstation
<pre>
   moa        IN A      129.97.108.74
              IN HINFO  "Apple Macintosh"  "MacOS"
              IN TXT    "CONTACT rwwatt"
              IN TXT    "LOCATION MC,1065"
              IN TXT    "DATE 1994-08-25"
</pre></p>

<h2><a name="record">TXT record definitions</a></h2>
 <p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>ORGUNIT</b>: identifies the community of users serviced. If the
community spans multiple groups in a subunit, then no group will be
registered. If the community spans multiple subunits in a unit, then no
subunit will be registered. For computing systems that are funded for
general campus-wide use across the academic and/or non-academic units, the
ORGUNIT designation will be one of {academic admin campus} depending on
whether it is for academic groups only, or non-academic groups only, or
both. The subnets that comprise the campus backbone network are designated
"campus". The major units are designated as AHS, ARTS, ENG, ENVST, MATH,
SCI, and LIB. For example, a subnet dedicated to the Groundwater research
group in the Earth Sciences department in the Science faculty would be
recorded as "Sci,EarthSci,Groundwater". For subnets in the non-academic
units, unit will be "admin" and subunit will be the department name. For
example, a subnet containing only computing systems that serve the
Registrar's Office would be recorded as "admin,Registrar". Registrations
for IST are recorded as "IST".</li>
 <li><b>ADMIN</b>: identifies the UWdir "uwuserid" of the person who
exercises policy-level authority, in accordance with established UW
directives, on behalf of ORGUNIT for all matters pertaining to the
computing system (or, for a subnet, for all of the computing systems
within the subnet).</li>
 <li><b>CONTACT</b>: identifies the uwuserid of the person designated by
ADMIN as having the authority and responsibility to take immediate action
to eliminate a network-impact problem being caused, whether by a computing
system or by a user. In order to provide a course of action when the
CONTACT cannot be located, CONTACT and ADMIN may not be the same
person.</li>
 <li><b>LOCATION</b>: for a device, is the building-code value and room
number where the device is installed; for a subnet, is the set of
buildings (or floors in one building) spanned by the cabling system that
forms that subnet.</li>
 <li><b>DATE</b>: is the yyyy-mm-dd specification for the date on which
this entry was last updated.</li>
 </ul>
 </p>

 <p>Instead of a UWuserid value, the <b>ADMIN</b> or <b>CONTACT</b> may 
be specified as a generic UW email address ... for example, the email
address for a list of people that provide the intended function.</p>
