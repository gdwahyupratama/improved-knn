<h1>Request For Information, CTT-2000 Consortium, revised 95Sep25</h1>
 <p>The CTT-2000 Consortium ("CTT") represents a number of organizations
("Subscriber") in Canada's Technology Triangle (the area encompassed by
Cambridge, Guelph, and Kitchener-Waterloo) that wish to have the use of a
local Internet-connected network ("Network") for IP connectivity between
themselves and the constituencies they serve, and with all other
Internet-connected entities in the local, regional, provincial, national,
and international communities. 
 <p>CTT wishes to enter into a multi-year service agreement ("Agreement")
for the provision and operation of this local network. This RFI has been
produced by a CTT subcommittee struck for the purpose of obtaining initial
proposals from organizations that the subcommittee expects have the
ability to be the provider/operator ("Operator") of the Network. 
 <p>The RFI is not complete; the subcommittee is making the current draft
available as an aid to further discussion, and such discussion may lead to
revision of the RFI. The RFI is not confidential; however, the content of
any response will be regarded as confidential information that is not to
be distributed beyond the Steering Committee. CTT would like to have the
beginnings of its network in operation in the Fall of 1995. Therefore, the
subcommittee would very much like to receive a response from you before
September 1. Your submission may consist of one or two parts. Part "A" is
your initial proposal to provide the environment described in the RFI, and
must be included. If you have an alternate proposal that you believe will
better serve CTT's needs, you may submit that as Part "B". 

<h2>Network Description</h2>
 <p>Conceptually, each Network point of presence ("POP") will consist of a
two-port IP router ("Router") with one interface connected to the Network
and the other interface connected to a Subscriber network or an external
network. The Network will interconnect the Subscriber-network POPs and the
external-network POPs. With the exception of planned outages (see
Scheduled Maintenance), the Network is to be in operation 24 hours a day,
every day.

 </pre>
 <p>No connections to the Network are to occur except by instruction from
CTT to the Operator. For each Subscriber, the Operator will establish a
POP on the Subscriber's premises. The Router will provide an IEEE/802.3
AUI interface to which the Subscriber will connect its internal network. 
Power to the POP equipment will be through an "uninteruptable power supply
(UPS)" device (specifications of the UPS are to be proposed in the
submission). One or more additional such POPs will exist to provide the
external connection(s) of the Network to the rest of the worldwide
Internet (premises and external provider are to be proposed in the
submission). 
 <p>A range of connection-speed offerings is required to meet the current
and evolving needs of CTT and its Subscribers. The topology and equipment
to be used in creating and managing the Network and the POPs is to be
proposed by the Operator. 
 <p>CTT itself will require one such Subscriber POP, at a speed necessary
to sustain the traffic to it. There is to be no cost attached to this
Subscriber POP, and the speed is to be automatically upgraded by the
Operator whenever necessary to keep pace with the traffic. 
 <p>The Operator will also establish a POP, on its premises, via which it
will connect its equipment from which it will perform the functions of the
Network Operations Centre ("NOC"), including the monitoring described in
the "Network Performance" section below. 

<h2>Modem Pool</h2>
 <p>The Operator will provide, at its POP, a contention-based dialup
facility consisting of phone lines connected to a pool of V.34/V.42bis
modems connected to ports on a communications server that provides
terminal-to-host connectivity via TELNET (essential) and RLOGIN
(optional), and dynamic-address IP connectivity via PPP (essential) and
SLIP (optional). 
 <p>Use of the facility is to require that each user be registered and
have a userid/password. Users are to be able to connect to Subscriber POPs
within the Network, but not to the external-network POP(s). The Operator
will handle the registration of users and the assignment of userids and
initial passwords, will bill the users for their use of the facility at a
"dollars per hour used" rate (to be proposed by the Operator), and will
maintain records of use sufficient to associate each use of the facility
with the user. Such records are to be kept for the most recent three
months, and the Operator will use these records to assist in
investigations of penetration attempts made from the facility. 

<h2>Routing Information</h2>
 <p>The Operator will ensure that full IP routing information is
propagated between all POPs ... the route to each Subscriber network, plus
a default route to the appropriate external network (to be proposed by
Operator). 

<h2>Router-Imposed Security</h2>
 <p>CTT will specify a set of basic constraints on the IP packets that are
to be permitted to and from the Subscriber networks, and the Operator will
ensure that that set of constraints is appropriately configured for each
POP. Such constraints are intended to provide a rudimentary level of
security, and will include simple specifications such as: 
 <ol>
 <li>no packet with a source-routing option is to be forwarded; 
 <li>no packet is to be forwarded to the Network from the Subscriber
network unless it has a source IP address inside the IP network number
assigned to the Subscriber network; 
 <li>no packet is to be forwarded from the Network to the Subscriber
network unless it has a source address outside the Subscriber network and
a destination address inside the Subscriber network; 
 <li>routes learned from the Subscriber networks will not be propagated. 
 </ol>
 <p>Anything more elaborate than the basic constraints will be the
responsibility of the Subscriber to provide for itself, using its
equipment on its internal network. 
 <p>The Operator will ensure that all Routers will be accessible via SNMP
from the Subscriber network at the CTT-located POP, and that the Router
that services a Subscriber POP will be accessible via SNMP from within
that Subscriber network. 

<h2>Scheduled Maintenance</h2>
 <p>Any scheduable work for which the Operator requires an outage of any
part of the Network is to be performed between 03:00 and 04:00 and
advertised by the Operator at least 48 hours in advance to a list of email
addresses to be provided by CTT. Any outage of a greater duration must be
requested by the Operator more than 7 days in advance and agreed to by
CTT; CTT will not unreasonably withhold its agreement to such requests. 
 <p>Any scheduable work for which the Subscriber requires an outage of the
POP on its premises may be scheduled at the Subscriber's discretion. The
Subscriber will advertise that outage at least 48 hours in advance to the
email list mentioned above. 

<h2>Network Operations Centre</h2>
 <p>From its equipment connected to the Network via its POP, the Operator
will provide a Network Operations Centre on a 24x7 basis. The functions
and activities of the NOC will include the following: 
 <ol>
 <li>conduct the monitoring described in the "Network Performance" 
sections below; 
 <li>provide support to the designated operations and technical-support
staffs of the Subscribers, in the form of liaison regarding the scheduling
of installation and maintenance work and a telephone "hot line" for
problem reporting and resolution; 
 <li>disseminate via E-mail the daily and monthly "Network Performance" 
reports and the the logs of the Subscriber-initiated and
Operator-initiated problem reports and their and resolutions; the full
reports and logs are to be sent to the CTT Technical Committee; each
Subscriber is to receive only the sections that pertain to its POP. 
 </ol>

<h2>Domain Name System</h2>
 <p>Each Subscriber will provide its own DNS primary server. The Operator
will use facilities connected via its POP to provide secondary DNS service
for each Subscriber network. 

<h2>Network Number and Domain Name</h2>
 <p>If requested by the Subscriber, the Operator will assist the
Subscriber in obtaining its own network number from the Canadian IP
Registrar and its own domain name from the CA Domain Registrar, by filling
out and submitting the necessary applications on behalf of the Subscriber. 
The network number and domain name obtained in this fashion will be
registered as belonging to the Subscriber, not to the Operator. 

<h2>Network Performance, Daily Reporting</h2>
 <p>The Operator will measure and report on the functioning of the Network
as described in the subsections below. Scheduled maintenance time is to be
excluded from these measurements. Each daily report will be made available
within eight hours of the end of that day, and will be a plain-text file
of the form... 
 <pre>
	{ YYYYMMDD  linkspeed  availability  latency  utilization
	{ POP          (Mbps)           (%)     (ms)          (%)
	{ --------  ---------  ------------  -------  -----------
	{ NOC         nnn.nnn         nnn.n    nnn.n        nnn.n
	{ external    nnn.nnn         nnn.n    nnn.n        nnn.n  
	{ Subscr A    nnn.nnn         nnn.n    nnn.n        nnn.n
	{ Subscr B    nnn.nnn         nnn.n    nnn.n        nnn.n
	{ [...]
	{ Subscr Z    nnn.nnn         nnn.n    nnn.n        nnn.n
	{ --------  ---------  ------------  -------  -----------
	{ average                     nnn.n    nnn.n        nnn.n  
 </pre>
 <p>The numeric values shall be determined as follows. 
 <p><b>Linkspeed</b>. This is the rated capacity of the link between the
Network and the POP, expressed in millions of bits per second available
for IP packets. 
 <p><b>Availability</b>. From its equipment connected within its internal
network at the NOC POP, at five-minute intervals, the Operator will send
five 1024-byte "ping" packets to each POP, including the NOC POP. The five
"ping" packets to a POP will be spaced one second apart. For each POP, the
daily "availability" percent is calculated as... 
 <pre>
	{       # of "ping" responses received within one second that day
	{ 100 * ---------------------------------------------------------
	{                   # of "ping" packets sent that day
 </pre>
 <p>A POP will be considered to be in an UP state if the response to each
of the five "ping" packets has been received within one second after the
"ping" is sent. Otherwise, the Operator will immediately declare that POP
to be in a DOWN state and will initiate a problem report. 
 <p><b>Latency</b>. For each of the five-minute intervals in Availability
above, calculate the average round-trip time in milliseconds for those
"ping" packets for which a response was received within one second, and
divide by two to obtain the one-way average. For each POP, the daily
"latency" value is the average of these one-way averages. 
 <p><b>Utilization</b>. For each POP, at thirty-minute intervals, the
Operator will collect the values of the two SNMP MIB counters "ifInOctets"
and "ifOutOctets" for the Router's Network interface. Any interval in
which either counter has overflowed will be discarded. The counters and
interval-width times for the remaining intervals for that Router for that
day will be summed and used to calculate a megabytes-per-second average
for each of the two counters. The "utilization" percent is determined by
expressing the larger of the two averages (assuming that the link is
bi-directional) as a percent of the linkspeed. 

<h2>Network Performance, Monthly Reporting</h2>
 <p>Each monthly report will show the monthly total or average for the
corresponding daily value, and will be made available within three working
days after the last day of that month. Also, for each POP, the following
two line-item values will be added to the monthly report. 
 <p><b>MTTRespond</b>. This is the average time, measured in hours from
the time a POP has been declared DOWN, for the Operator's agent to arrive
on-site when the cause cannot be determined and rectified by Subscriber
personnel upon having been contacted by the Operator. 
 <p><b>MTTRepair</b>. This is the average time, measured in hours from the
time a POP has been declared DOWN, for the POP to be restored to the UP
state. 
 <p><b>Modem-Pool Contention</b>. A second section of the monthly report,
separate from the foregoing, will show the number of ports, the total
number of user sessions during the month, the total amount of connect time
during the month, and the total amount of time that all ports were
concurrently all in use (expressed as hours per day averaged over the
month). 

<h2>Network Performance, Monthly Objectives</h2>
 <p><b>Availability</b>. The Operator will be considered by CTT to have
met its availability objective that month if the monthly average of the
daily "average percent availability" values is 99.5% or greater. 
 <p><b>Latency</b>. For each connection-speed offering, the Operator will
initially propose an expected "latency" value. The Operator will be
considered by CTT to have met its latency objective that month if the
reported "latency" value for every POP is less than its expected "latency"
value. 
 <p><b>MTTRespond</b>. The Operator will be considered by CTT to have met
its MTTRespond objective that month if the monthly MTTRespond value is
less than one hour. 
 <p><b>MTTRepair</b>. The Operator will be considered by CTT to have met
its MTTRepair objective that month if the monthly MTTRepair value is less
than two hours. 
 <p><b>Modem-Pool Contention</b>. The Operator will be considered by CTT
to have met its contention objective that month if the monthly average of
the daily all-in-use times is less than two hours. 
 <p>The Operator will warrant to CTT that the Operator will at all times
maintain sufficient capacity in all components of the Network such that it
will meet all of the above objectives every month. 

<h2>Additional Reporting</h2>
 <p>CTT will require the best-available management information as on-going
input to its review and decision-making processes regarding the Network
and its evolution. The Operator is expected to use the Network Performance
measurements as the basis for making timely recommendations to CTT on the
need to upgrade the appropriate components of the Network.  From time to
time, CTT will also require that the Operator provide additional insight
on these matters, in forms such as making presentations elaborating on the
state of the Network at meetings of CTT's board of directors at agreed-to
times, or by making agreed-to alterations in the performance monitoring
and reporting described above. 

<h2>Payment</h2>
 <p>There are to be no volume-based charges to CTT or its Subscribers for
the use of the Network. All payments to the Operator under this Agreement
are to be made by the Subscribers in the form of a fixed charge per month,
based solely on the Mbps connection speed of the link from the Network to
the Subscriber POP. In its submission, the Operator will propose a "rate
sheet" of such costs, for each connection-speed offering that it proposes
to provide. 

<h2>The Operator as a Cooperative</h2>
 <p>If the Operator proposes to enter into agreements with other
organizations for purposes of providing some of the services of this
Agreement, the Operator will identify those proposed organizations in its
submission. After the signing of the Agreement, CTT's consent shall be
required before the Operator may alter the composition of the Cooperative;
CTT will not unreasonably withhold such consent. 
 <p>The Operator will invite the head of CTT, or delegate(s) to be
appointed as deemed appropriate by the head, to attend and participate in
all meetings of the Operator or the Cooperative that may be relevant to
CTT's interests. Notwithstanding the existence of such a Cooperative, the
Operator will warrant that CTT need look solely to the Operator for
provision, operation, management and performance of the Network and the
performance of related services under this Agreement. 

<h2>Acceptance</h2>
 <p>The Agreement will be considered as accepted when it is signed by CTT
and the Operator. The Network will be considered to be accepted by CTT
when the Operator has meet its objectives for two consecutive months. Any
delay in acceptance of the Network by CTT shall not change the Term of the
Agreement. 

<h2>Rebates</h2>
 <p>For any month (after acceptance of the Network) during which the
Operator objectives are not met for any particular component (Subscriber
POP, external-networks POP, or modem pool), the Operator shall credit the
appropriate entity (the Subscriber in the case of a subscriber POP, and
CTT otherwise) with a monetary rebate prorated [to be determined]. 

<h2>Additional Capacity</h2>
 <p>CTT and its Subscribers shall have the option of acquiring additional
capacity. The Operator will offer that additional capacity at the more
favourable of: the prices, terms, and conditions of the Agreement; or the
prices, terms, and conditions then offered by the Operator to its most
favoured customers. 

<h2>Marketing of the Network</h2>
 <p>CTT and the Operator will jointly market the Network to potential
Subscribers within the area served by the Network.
