 <p>UW's KW-area connectivity is via analog dial-up lines using 33.6Kbps
modems. 
 <p>One of the most promising new technologies for home-to-campus
connectivity is likely to be "Universal Asynchronous Digital Subscriber
Line" (UADSL), which will involve a "splitterless" home interface device
that is UADSL on the telco side and Ethernet on the home-computer side,
enabling standard "voice" telephony plus IP networking over the same
copper phone line. The network connection is permanent (always "on").  The
carrier will transmit the home subscriber's IP traffic via its IP network.
 <p>Cable companies are pursuing offerings based on shared-medium CATV
coax to the home, with a home device that is CATV on the cableco side and
Ethernet on the home-computer side, with the IP traffic backhauled to the
institution on an ATM transmission system. The new DOCSIS data-over-cable
technology will address the traffic-spying security exposures inherent in
a shared-medium transmission system. 
 <p>For more information, see the UW <a href="../index.html#Home" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/#Home">RFI</a> for
high-speed IP connectivity to the KW-area homes of UW faculty, staff, and
students.
