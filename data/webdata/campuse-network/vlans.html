<h1>Switching, VLANs, routing, multicast</h1>

 <p><b>Switching</b> is a layer-two (transmission) function. A switch is a
device that interconnects multiple cabling systems into a single
transmision system. The device or the cabling-system segment that is
connected to a switch port exists in its own independent "collision
domain". Multiple ports on the switch can be grouped into a "broadcast
domain" ... a virtual multi-segment transmission system, referred to as a
"Virtual Local-Area Network", or VLAN. Each VLAN is completely unware of
the existence of any other VLANs. 

 <p><b>Routing</b> is a layer-tree (network) function. A router is a
device that interconnects multiple networks (or network subnets, in the
case of a subnetted netork). A campus network the magnitude of UW's cannot
exist as a single unsubnetted network. Segmentation into multiple subnets
is essential to maintaining the locality-of-reference isolation of traffic
between the server and client computing systems within a subnet. In the
architecture of the UW campus network, a layer-three IP subnet is
implemented as a layer-two VLAN.

 <p><b>Multicast</b>. In IP networking, a special range of IP network
numbers permits an IP packet to be addressed so that it will be delivered
to multiple destinations. Each special address designates an "IP multicast
group", and a computing system that wishes to participate in that
multicast group uses a special IP protocol (IGMP) to transmit that desire
to the local IP routing device that services it. All of the IP routing
devices between all of the members of a multicast group have to exchange
the group-membership information and keep it up to date so that each
routing device will know to which of its connected networks a packet for a
particular multicast group must be delivered. Similarly, a layer-two
switch must know how to keep track of which of its ports have devices that
are participating in that multicast group (if a switch cannot do that, it
must broadcast frames containing such packets to all of its ports, which
is not at all desirable).

 <p><b>Integration</b>. A new breed of core-class device has emerged in
the marketplace that contains a layer-two switching processor plus a
layer-three routing processor. The full integration of routing and
switching into a single device will eventually enable a simpler and more
robust topology. Eventually, cost-effective choices will emerge that will
permit the necessary packet-prioritization and packet-routing and
multicast functions to be moved out to the "edge" and performed in
workgroup-class devices.
