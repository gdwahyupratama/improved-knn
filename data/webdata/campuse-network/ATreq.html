<h1>AppleTalk requests and registrations</h1>
<p>2001-12-18</p>

 <p>A request for the assignment of an AppleTalk zone is to be mailed to
<a href="mailto:hostmaster@cnoc.uwaterloo.ca">hostmaster</a>. A request
submitted by any person other than the CNAG representative responsible for
the requestor's constituency will be forwarded to the CNAG representative
for confirmation before being processed further. No device that uses the
AppleTalk zone may be connected to the network until the AppleTalk zone
been assigned and registered.</p>

 <p>AppleTalk zone-number assignments are derived from IP subnet number
within which the AppleTalk devices using the requested zone will exist. To
provide a reasonable number of AppleTalk zone numbers for each IP subnet,
the range of permitted zone numbers is a subset of the IP subnet number
times 100. For IP subnet number xxx (129.97.xxx), the range of permitted
zone numbers is from xxx00 to xxx19. The AppleTalk zone numbers for
tunnels defined in this IP subnet would also be assigned from this range
of zone numbers.</p>
