<h2><a name="terms">Terminology</a></h2>
 <p>An <b>internet</b> is the general term for any interconnection of
multiple IP networks. UW's network is an internet. Each of UW's
interconnected transmission systems constitutes one subnet of UW's IP
network (129.97). The interconnection of these subnets forms the internet
that is internal to UW.</p>
 <p>An <b>intranet</b> is an internet that is internal to a single
organization. Therefore UW's internet is an intranet.</p>
 <p>An <b>extranet</b> is an internet that interconnects the intranets of
a specific set of organizations. An organization's network can be part of
more than one extranet. UW's network is part of an extranet formed by the
organizations that are members of the <a href=http://www.onet.on.ca/>ONet
Networking</a> corporation.</p>
 <p>The <b>Internet</b> is the global interconnection of all of the
intranets and extranets that exist at municipal, regional, provincial,
national, and international levels throughout the world.</p>

<h2><a name="LRef">Locality-of-reference network architecture</a></h2>
 <p>The corridor wiring-closet workgroup Ethernet switch and the computers
connected to it form "the local workgroup" for an organizational unit. In
a perfectly-architected computing environment, this local workgroup will
contain all of the organizational unit's server machines and all of its
client machines that depend on those servers. This is the "locality of
reference" principle. Some client/server configurations are capable of
excessive volumes of traffic. Common examples are a collection of diskless
workstations and their filesystem server(s), or a collection of X stations
and the computing system(s) on which their processing occurs.
Traffic-intense client/server configurations should be connected to the
same workgroup switch, so that the traffic between them remains local to
the switch.</p>

<h3>Level-one network</h3>
 <p>The level-one (campus backbone) network contains those things that are
essential as institution-wide network resources, such as the
switches/routers that connect to the level-two networks, the device that
connects to the ONet network and the rest of the worldwide Internet, the
computing systems that are dedicated as the primary servers for (for
example) the Domain Name System, campus authentication, the UWdir
corporate directory, the primary news server (news.uwaterloo.ca), and the
terminal servers that enable access from off campus via the dial-up modem
pool.</p>

<h3>Level-two networks</h3>
 <p>To achieve locality of reference and survivability so that the
level-two network and any lower-level networks that it contains can
survive as a functioning standalone network during an outage of the
level-one routing device by which it is connected, each level-two network
should have within it those servers that are essential to the operation of
the other computing systems within that level-two network and any
connected lower-level networks. Network services that should be provided
within the level-two network include a caching Domain Name System server,
file-system servers and backup, servers for X stations and personal
computers, mail server for client computers running user-agent mailing
software, MX handling for computers that are not operated on a continuous
basis, and other functions as deemed appropriate by IST and the
administrative entity responsible for the organizational unit(s) serviced
by the level-two network.</p>

<h3>Lower-level networks</h3>
 <p>In the evolution of the campus network, the objective is to minimize
the number of lower-level networks. Requests for the creation of such
networks will not normally be accepted unless there are special-technology
conditions that cannot otherwise be accomodated.</p>

<h2>Transmission-layer switching and network-layer routing</h2>

 <p>A <b><a name="l2">transmission</a> system</b> is a physical construct.
It is the bottom layer of the adjacent simplified four-layer model. It
comprises both the local cabling-system medium to which nearby devices are
connected and a protocol for transmiting data between those devices via
that medium. Communication outside the local transmission system to which
a device is connected requires the use of a network-layer protocol. A
<b><a name="l3">network</a></b> is a virtual construct. It consists of an
addressing scheme that is independent of the multiple local transmission
systems across which it operates, and a protocol that is used to transmit
packets of information between devices in different transmission systems
via their network-layer addresses rather than their transmission-layer
addresses.</p>

 </table>
 <p>UW's data-transmission protocol is <b>Ethernet</b> ... at 10Mbps in
most places, at 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) where needed today, at 1000Mbps
(Gigabit Ethernet) where needed in a few years, and at 10Gbps (Fast
Gigabit Ethernet, or "10GbE") when the need grows beyond that. UW's two
cabling-system media are fibre (for the backbone and its links into
buildings) and unshielded twisted-pair (Category-5/5e UTP) copper wire
(for the links to workstations and servers), interconnected by multi-port
repeaters (obsolete, transmit everything to every port) or <b>switches</b>
(current, transmit only to the specific port at which the destination
device is connected). There are a few other cabling-system and
interconnection-device technologies in various corners of the network; a
few exist for the purpose of conducting research into those technologies,
but most exist only for historical reasons (they made sense at the time,
and the funds and/or the need to replace them do not yet exist).</p>
 <p><img class="layers" webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Diagrams/fibreTOP.gif" alt="fibre" align="right">The backbone fibre topology consists of eleven multi-pair fibre
bundles linking nine backbone wiring centres. The first two bundles
(MC-BMH and BMH-GSC) were installed in the early 1990s with multiple pairs
of multi-mode fibres and no single-mode fibres because of some specific
deadline constraints. All core bundles installed since then have both
multi-mode and single-mode pairs. The single-mode fibre is being held in
reserve for some future very-high-speed transmission system (may be
required for Gigabit or 10Gb Ethernet over the longer links).</p>
 <p>The <a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Diagrams/UWngTOP.gif">backbone switching topology</a>
is a core of ten enterprise-class Ethernet switches from the Cisco
Catalyst 5500 family.</p>
 <p>The workgroup-class switches are from the Cisco Catalyst 1900, 2900,
and 3500 families. The primary workgroup switch now being acquired is the
C3548, which provides 48 10/100Mbps UTP ports and a slot for a Gbps fibre
module. The C1900s are the lowest-cost switches; they have 24 10Mbps UTP
ports, 1 10Mbps AUI port, and 2 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) ports (2 UTP, or
one UTP and one fibre).</p>

<h3>The network layer</h3>
 <table class="layers">
 <tr><td>applications</td></tr>
 <tr><td>computing systems</td></tr>
 <tr><th>network</th></tr>
 <tr><td>transmission systems</td></tr>
 </table>
 <p>UW's network protocol is IP (the "Internet Protocol"). A device knows
how to map IP network-layer virtual addresses into Ethernet
tranmission-layer physical addresses only for the transmision system to
which the device is itself connected; there is no knowledge of physical
addresses outside the local transmission system. Therefore, the different
transmission-system segments of the network are interconnected by
"routing" devices that determine the transmission system into which to
send a packet based on the IP address of the destination. Each device on a
transmission system must know the physical address of the device that
performs the IP routing that provides the paths to devices outside the
local transmission system.</>
 <p>In UW's multi-level <a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Diagrams/subnets.gif">IP subnet
topology</a>, each level-two network is a subnet whose routing function is
provided by a routing module in one of the backbone Ethernet switches.
Some second-level subnets also contain lower-level subnets whose routing
function is provided by a dual-connected computing system in the level-two
subnet, usually because the lower-level subnet is still using an obsolete
"unswitched" transmission system. That practice is expected to gradually
cease over time as the organizational units responsible for those
lower-level subnets encounter the need to upgrade.</p>

<h3><a name="sw-rt">Integrated Ethernet switching and IP routing</a></h3>
 <p>The two primary core nodes are Cisco Catalyst 5500 devices. Each
includes Ethernet switching and a route-processor module. The two
route-processor modules can interoperate to provide load-balanced routing
and an automatic backup in case of an outage of one of them. Each of the
links between the two C5500s is 100Mbps full-duplex (100Mbps in each
direction); they operate concurrently and do load balancing (a feature
that most Ethernet switches allow as long as the multiple links are
between the same two switches).</p>
 <p>The other core nodes are Cisco Catalyst 5505s or 5509s that include
Ethernet switching and a form of IP-routing integration ... by watching
for between-subnet traffic that is sent out a port to one of the two
route-processor C5500 devices and comes back on that same port destined
for a port in a different subnet, the switching engine learns how to
switch subsequent local traffic between those two subnets locally. Each of
the links from these switches to the two C5500s is 100Mbps
full-duplex.</p>

<h2><a name="wkgps">Client-Server workgroups</a></h2>
 <p>Some "client-server workgroup" network-distributed computing systems
use non-IP protocols for the provision of services between the server and
its clients. Historically, these have been special-purpose protocols for
user-authentication or print-server or file-server facilities. UW's
stategic direction for campus-network integration is to pursue the
provision of such services within the framework of the IP-standards
environment.
 <ul>
 <li>UW's <a href="http://polaris.uwaterloo.ca/"><b>Waterloo
Polaris</b></a> is completing its transition to a fully-IP network layer
from its origins as the "Watstar" network-distributed computing
system.</li>
 <li>Microsoft's <b>Windows</b> operating systems use some non-IP
protocols in its "network neighbourhood", but these are not passed between
the different IP subnets of the campus network.</li>
 <li>Apple's <b>AppleTalk</b> is not IP, but the routing devices in the
level-one network are also capable of routing the "AppleTalk Phase II"  
protocol. However, there is no long-term commitment to continue to route
AppleTalk as an enterprise-wide network protocol.</li>
 <li>Novell's <b>NetWare</b> protocols are not supported.</li>
 </ul>
