<h1>Excessive use from a ResNet-connected computer</h1>

 <br>Every term, a very small minority of those with ResNet connections
repeatedly consume far more than the per-user <a href="../guarmin.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/guarmin.html">fair share</a> of UW's bandwidth. In 1998, <a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/">IST</a> established a system of limits,
based on experiences to date and in consultation with <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infocist/">UCIST</a>. Utilization
patterns demonstrate that these limits impact only that small minority of
the residents. The limits are subject to change in the future based on
further experience and evolving mechanisms for conserving resources to
maximize their availability for the largest number of users.</p>

<h2>Limits</h2>
 <p>Use of UW's <a href="../index.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/">internal and external network resources</a>
from a <a href="index.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/Residence/">ResNet</a>-connected computer is excessive
in the context of UW's mission if the volume of on-campus plus external
traffic to and from that computer exceeds any of the following limits.
This does NOT mean "all use that is within these limits is acceptable".
Problems arising from use for purposes <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infocist/use98.htm">other than those
intended</a> by the University in your role as a member of the UW
community will be pursued as misuse.</p>

<p><center><table bgcolor="beige" class="border" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2" width="90%">

 <tr align="left" bgcolor="gold">
 <th>limit</th>
 <th>constraint period if limit exceeded</th>
 </tr>

 <tr align="left" valign="top">

<p>All traffic outside the local residence network (see <a href="index.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/Residence/">topology diagrams</a>) is counted, 24 hours a day,
every day. The limits are checked only if you have consumed more that the
per-ResNet-user <a href="../guarmin.html#alloc" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/guarmin.html#alloc">fair share</a> for the
day. Exceeding (1) or (2) will move you into the constrained-bandwidth
queue for the duration of the corresponding constraint period. The
constrained-bandwidth queue provides very-low-speed access to/from
computers outside the local residence network. Initially, the queue's
bandwidth is sufficient for text-only applications, but the queue becomes
more congested as the number of people in the queue increases during the
constraint period.</p>

 <p>See <a href="logic.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/Residence/logic.html">method</a> for an algorithmic
summary of the process by which the totals are accumulated and the
constraints are applied. For recent usage statistics, see the <a href="http://noc.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Stats/resReport">ResNet daily report</a>.
For more detail, see the <a href="history.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/Residence/history.html">history</a>
and <a href="directions.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/Residence/directions.html">directions</a> documents.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
 <p>UW's <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infoprov/Planning/final_plan97/f-fulldoc1.html">mission</a>
is to advance learning and knowledge through teaching, research, and
scholarship. UW is not an Internet Service Provider. An ISP is an
organization whose mission is to provide Internet connectivity to other
entities. UW does not provide Internet connectivity to non-UW entities.
UW's computing and network resources are provided so that UW students,
faculty, and staff can pursue their respective activities in support of
UW's mission, as per <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy66.pdf">Policy
66</a> and the <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infocist/use98.htm">Statement on Use of
UW Computing and Network Resources</a>.</p>

 <p>Extending the campus network into the student residences managed by UW
and its federated/affiliated institutions was one part of the objective to
enable high-speed connectivity from the campus network into the homes of
UW students, faculty, and staff (see the <i>Teaching and Learning</i>
section of the <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infocist/Directions1998.html">1998
Directions Statement</a> published by <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infocist/">UCIST</a>). In deciding to
use the ResNet connection in your residence room, it is important that you
understand that that is why it exists.</p>

 <p>The <a href="../index.html" webstripperlinkwas="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/cn/">campus network and its
external connections</a> are resources that must be shared and used
appropriately by UW's community of more than 20,000 students, faculty, and
staff. All members of the UW community are responsible for ensuring that
 <ul>
 <li>use that is not related to UW's mission does not impact on the
availability of a resource for use that is, and</li>
 <li>any need to increase the capacity of a resource is due to the
growth of mission-relevant use.</li>
 </ul>
