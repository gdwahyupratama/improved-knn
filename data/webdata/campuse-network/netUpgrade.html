<h1>Network upgrade<br>status report</h1>
 <p>2000-05-12
 <br>As reported in the Daily Bulletin of March 28 (<a href="http://www.bulletin.uwaterloo.ca/2000/mar/28tu.html">UW welcomes
infrastructure funds</a>), UW is in the midst of a multi-year project to
upgrade the <a href="index.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/">campus network</a> infrastructure. The upgrades
include connections in individual offices, wiring within buildings, and
faster transmission equipment everywhere. This is part of a never-ending
effort to meet UW's infrastructure needs by pursuing continuing advances
in network technology.</p>

<h2>Phase one</h2>
 <p>Phase one of the project started in 1997 and took until the end of
1998 to complete. It resulted in 12 <a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Diagrams/UWngTOP.gif">core</a> Ethernet switches and two routing
modules, and an initial 70 workgroup Ethernet switches, sufficient to
establish "points of presence" in many buildings and upgrade 1800 computer
connections. Most of those workgroup switches provide each computer with a
dedicated 10Mbps (ten million bits per second) connection to the switch. A
few have dual-mode ability for both 10Mbps and 100Mbps connections. The
"uplink" from the workgroup switch toward the core of the network operates
at 100Mbps. Most of the funding came from a $700K grant from the
Canada/Ontario Infrastructure Works (COIW) program.</p>

<h2>Phase two</h2>
 <p>Phase two of the project started in 1999 and will take until 2002 to
complete. It involves installing additional twisted-pair (UTP) cabling and
Ethernet switches to replace old coax cabling and Ethernet repeaters that
provide about 4000 computer connections in academic areas. Most switch
connections will be 10/100Mbps, with a 100Mbps uplink and the ability to
upgrade that to 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) when needed in the future.
Funding is via grants from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI),
the Ontario Research and Development Challenge Fund (ORDCF), and the
Ontario Innovation Trust (OIT), plus UW money, totaling $1.7M over the
three years. Those grants cannot be used for upgrades in areas such as
teaching-facility computer workrooms or non-academic buildings such as
Needles Hall. At the same time, additional grants in support of the Bell
Canada University Labs project are providing network upgrades for the
research groups in the Davis Centre.</p>

<h2>Future upgrades</h2>
 <p>There are currently more than <a href="http://noc.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Stats/netsize/report">11,000</a>
computers in the campus network. Teaching-area facilities and the
non-academic buildings that are still using coax cabling and/or Ethernet
repeaters will be upgraded, where needed, as/when funds become available
to the University.</p>

 <p>One of the objectives for the UW campus network is that it be well
connected to the <a href="external.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/external.html">external communities</a> of
greatest interest to UW.  Membership in the provincial <a href="http://www.onet.on.ca/">ONet Networking</a> corporation is providing
that connectivity for UW at the provincial, national, and international
levels. The ONet network is connected to a number of national networks in
Canada, each of which also provides international connections to the US
and other countries, which in turn have connections to national networks
in additional countries. One of the national networks in Canada is <a href="http://www.canarie.ca/advnet/canet3.html">CA*net3</a>, the "Optical
IP" multi-gigabit backbone network that interconnects the provincial
research/education networks like ONet.</p>

 <p>Currently, UW's ONet connection is in two distinct parts, a "general
Internet" connection, and a separate "university communities" connection.
The university-communities connection carries all traffic to and from most
of the other universities in Ontario, and, via CA*net3, the universities
in the rest of Canada and the many universities in the US and a half-dozen
other countries that have "advanced Internet" networks like CA*net3. This
link will become 1Gbps once the Ontario's Ministry of Energy, Science, and
Technology (MEST) <a href="http://www.networks-ontario.com/e-call.html">provincial "Optical IP"
backbone network (ORION)</a> becomes a reality.</p>

 <p>Of course, that does not improve UW's general-Internet connectivity.
That link is always the <a href="http://noc.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Stats/trends">most heavily loaded</a> and
by far the most expensive of all the links in the campus network. Such
general-Internet connectivity is a commodity that is "volume priced" by
the national and international Internet Service Providers. UW benefits
from the high-volume discount that ONet Networking is able to obtain from
those ISPs by aggregating the needs of its members. However,
general-Internet connectivity does not hold the attention of granting
agencies that provide funding to support research and education. So, for
the general-Internet link, we are exploring various "Quality of Service"
queuing mechanisms in the continuing attempt to ensure that use that is
not related to UW's mission does not impact on availability for use that
is.</p>

 <p>To help reduce the load on the general-Internet link and at the same
time improve connectivity with the KW-area local community, we provide <a href="local.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/local.html">direct connections</a> with interested local ISPs.
It is not yet known what impact the provincial <a href="http://www.est.gov.on.ca/connect/index.htm">Connect Ontario</a>
program will have on improved network-layer connectivity between UW and
the KW-area local community.</p>
