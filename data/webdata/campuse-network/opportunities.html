<h1>In search of infinite bandwidth at zero cost</h1>
<p>1990-02-19
</div>

<h2>Problems</h2>
 <p>The fibre cabling system of the level-one network and the UTP
cabling systems of the level-three networks are well positioned for
high-speed transmission technologies. 
 <p>Unfortunately, the coax cabling systems that still exist in all
level-two networks and in many level-three networks are functionally
obsolete. If everything stays as is, they will continue to have a useful
"present" for years to come, but they already have no "future". 

<h2>Opportunities</h2>
 <p>The Ethernet "multiport repeater" that became a marketplace commodity
by 1994 provides "shared Ethernet", in which the UTP-connected devices
contend for the 10Mbps aggregate capacity. It has now been obsoleted by
the Ethernet "switch", in which each port has its own dedicated bandwidth
and the ports are internally connected by a multi-bridge bus with
aggregate bandwidth sufficient to guarantee concurrent rated-speed
connectivity between all pairs of ports.

<p>A <b>full-duplex Ethernet</b> link is possible when there is only a
single device at each end of the link. Rather than using one direction for
traffic and the other direction for collision-detection signaling, it is
then possible to send traffic in both directions concurrently.

<h2>The need for speed</h2>
 <p>The information in the table below has been taken from "Networking
requirements of audio and motion video", a paper by Francois Fluckiger of
CERN, printed in the January 1996 edition of "ConneXions -- the
Interoperability Report", published by Interop Company
<connexions@interop.com>.

 <p>The high-bandwidth applications require a "quality of service" (QoS) 
that will be faciliated by Ethernet evolution (802.1p enables 8-level
priority) and newer IP "service differentiation" mechanisms such as IP ToS
priority queuing, the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP), the Real-time
Transmission Protocol (RTP), and IP <a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Diagrams/multicast.gif">multicasting</a>. None of this is really
"ready for prime time" yet. Also, IPv6, the "next generation" version of
the IP protocol, will further enhance these mechanisms; it was
standardized in 1995, but it could be as much as 20 years before IPv6
becomes "the norm".
