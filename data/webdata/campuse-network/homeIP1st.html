<h1>UW Home Connectivity</h1>
<p>Request For Information
<br>1998-07-10
</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
 <p>University of Waterloo is seeking to enter into exploratory
discussions leading to the formation of long-term relationships with one
or more companies that will provide high-speed IP connectivity between the
UW campus network and the homes of UW's faculty, staff, and students.</p>

<h2>Overview of current environment</h2>
 <p>The UW campus network contains over 11,000 IP addresses servicing
Ethernet-connected computers in labs, offices, and on-campus student
residences. Connectivity between the campus network, the Internet, and
CA*net-II is provided under a multi-year contract with the ONet Networking
corporation.</p>
 <p>UW provides facilities for dial-up IP access from the homes of UW
faculty, staff, and students in the Kitchener-Waterloo area to the campus
network via PPP over a pool of 224 analog phone lines equipped with USR
33.6 "Sportster" modems connected to several Bay "Annex Remote 4000" 
Terminal Server devices in the campus network. The modem-pool phone lines
are provided by Bell Canada under a multi-year Centrex/UCD service
agreement. UW charges its modem-pool subscribers $0.40 per hour of use in
order to recover its costs. UW expects to continue to operate this
modem-pool facility as the vehicle for slow-speed low-cost IP access from
home for as long as sufficient demand within the UW community exists. 
However, a modem-pool facility cannot meet the need for high-speed IP
access to/from the campus network for the growing number of UW people who
wish to be able to use campus-network facilities from home in the same way
that they use them on campus.</p>

<h2>Overview of proposed relationship and environment</h2>
 <p>Each company with which UW will partner to provide the high-speed IP
service is hereafter referred to as a "provider". Each member of the UW
community who will contract to use the service is hereafter referred to as
a "subscriber".</p>
 <p>UW wishes to out-source the provider responsibility. UW wishes to
select the provider(s) and have the service in operation and available to
the subscribers not later than 1999-04-30 ... but preferably well before
that. UW is willing to consider an exclusive relationship with a chosen
provider for some initial "trial" period if conditions for doing so seem
significantly favourable to UW and its subscribers.</p>

<h3>The service to be provided</h3>
 <p>High-speed IP connectivity between the "telecommuting" subscriber and
the UW campus network is the focal point of the service being sought.
Ideally, a range of subscriber transmission-speed offerings is envisioned,
from a low of a hundred kilobits per second up to a high of several
megabits per second. For some subscribers, the nature of the work will
require high speed in both directions.</p>
 <p>The contractual agreements and financial transactions pertaining to
the subscriber's use of the service will be between the subscriber and the
provider. The provider will be responsible for all matters pertaining to
the subscriber service (installation of provider's equipment to and at the
subscriber's home, billing the subscriber for the service, subscriber
"helpdesk" trouble reporting and resolution, etc). The cost to the
subscriber is expected to be lower than the cost of services sold by the
provider that include (for example) customer userids and filespace on the
provider's email and web servers, since the UW-community subscribers can
use their home computers as clients to computing-system servers at UW for
those purposes.</p>

<h3>Subscriber connection</h3>
 <p>The service demarcation point between the subscriber and the provider
will be a provider-supplied device located at the subscriber's home. The
technology used should be such that the contents of the IP packets between
the subscriber and UW are not visible to any other party within the
provider's network (except by those of its employees authorized by the
provider as and when required to diagnose and correct problems within the
provider's network).</p>

<h3>UW connection</h3>
 <p>The preferred service demarcation point between the provider and UW is
a 100Mbps Ethernet port on one of UW's campus-network backbone switches,
with migration to a 1000Mbps Ethernet port as utilization on the
provider/UW link grows. The provider will be responsible for all costs
pertaining to bringing its network to this UW demarcation point. (As a
short-term initial alternative, UW can consider providing a 155Mbps ATM
port as the demarcation point.)
 
<h3>Addressing and routing</h3>
 <p>The provider will assign the subscriber an IP address from a
provider-obtained IP network number (for many subscribers, a dynamic
DHCP-assigned IP address will be acceptable; for some subscribers, a
permanent IP address may be required). On the provider/UW link, the
provider will deliver to UW only those packets that originate within the
provider's IP network and specify a destination within UW's IP network,
and UW will deliver to the provider only those packets that originate
within UW's IP network and specify a destination within the provider's IP
network.</p>

<h3>Number of subscribers</h3>
 <p>It is difficult to estimate the number of subscribers that this
high-speed IP service will attract over time, since demand will be a
function of cost. However, something on the order of a hundred faculty and
staff and several hundred students within the first year of operation is
possible.</p>

<h2>Response from prospective providers</h2>
 <p>An initial written response is requested by 1998-08-31 outlining how
the provider proposes to address each of the above, including 
 <ol>
 <li>whether UW will need to identify the subscriber to the provider; if
so, how;</li>
 <li>whether the service will also be available to subscribers in non-KW
locations; if so, where and how;</li>
 <li>the various connection speeds for which the subscriber will be able
to contract, and what and how the provider proposes to charge the
subscriber;</li>
 <li>the latency and loss values that the provider will guarantee as upper
bounds for IP packets between the subscriber and UW through the provider's
network to/from the UW demarcation point;</li>
 <li>the latency and loss values that the subscriber can normally expect
to experience for (non-UW) traffic through the provider's network to/from
its point(s) of interconnection with the rest of the Internet;</li> 
 <li>the date by which the provider will have the service in operation;
and</li>
 <li>items that the provider wishes to discuss in detail with UW.</li>
 </ol></p>

<h2>Alternative responses</h2>
 <p>UW's preference is to seek an outsourced solution as described above. 
However, if you cannot respond in the context of a provider but you can
respond in the context of a company that is able to supply both the
necessary technology and the assistance to help UW to be its own
"provider" in some fashion, please do so.</p>

<h2>UW contact</h2>
 <p>Responses, requests for clarification, etc, should be addressed to:
 <address>Roger Watt
 <br>Information Systems and Technology
 <br>University of Waterloo
 <br>Waterloo, Ontario, Canada
 <br>N2L 3G1
 <br>phone: 519-888-4567, extension 2491
 <br>email: rwwatt@ist.uwaterloo.ca
 </address></p>

<h2>Evaluation process</h2>
 <p>UW will evaluate each initial written response and will be the sole
judge of whether it warrants further pursuit. Those selected will each be
invited to enter into further discussion with UW. Among the issues of
major concern to UW in making this selection are: 
 <ul>
 <li>UW's opinion of the reputation of the submittor as a provider of
Internet-access products and services and its proven commitment to quality
customer service and timely technology upgrades;</li>
 <li>a direct relationship with the provider for a single point of contact
for support by UW and by UW's subscribers (ie, no third-party integrators
or subcontractors);</li>
 <li>subscriber prices and contractual terms.</li>
 </ul></p>

 <p>At the end of the RFI process, UW may choose to pursue an initial
implementation with one or more providers, or to become its own
"provider", or to issue a formal RFP for outsourcing the service, or defer
a decision until some later date when conditions might seem more
favourable.</p>
