<p>A <b>firewall</b> is the generic term for any kind of barrier that
prevents the spread of something harmful. Understanding any particular
firewall requires understanding what the harmful thing is and how the
firewall prevents it from spreading. See <a href="../netdescr.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/netdescr.html">Campus Network Description</a> and <a href="netmgmt.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/Admin/netmgmt.html">Campus Network Management</a> for background
information.</p>

<h2><a name="common">Common firewalls</a></h2>

<p>Simple firewalls exist both at the transmission-system layer and the
network layer.</p>

<h3>At the transmission-system layer</h3>

<p><ul>

 <li><b>The Ethernet interface in a computer is a firewall, under normal
operation</b>. The harmful thing is the volume of frames on the
cabling-system segment to which it is connected. Under normal operation,
the interface ignores all frames except those that are addressed to its
computer and those that are "multicast" frames (which, by definition, must
be examined by all devices connected to a transmission system). This is
not a problem in an Ethernet-switch transmission system, but it is a
serious concern in a shared-medium transmission system. 
 <p><i>A person who has control of the machine's operating system can
instruct its Ethernet interface to pass all frames that transit the
cabling-system segment to the computer for processing. This is the essence
of a "frame analyzer" (sometimes referred to as a "packet sniffer"  or
"packet snooper"). In the hands of an authorized technical-support person
trusted to perform problem-diagnosis tasks, it is an essential tool. In
the hands of anyone else, it is a harmful thing.</i></p>
 </li>

 <li><b>A repeater is not a firewall</b>. The purpose of a repeater is
to take the transmission-system "frame" that it has received from one of
its ports and repeat that frame to all of its other ports. In the 1980s,
we used repeaters to joint two thick-wire coax cable segments, or to joint
one thick-wire and multiple thin-wire coax segments. In the early 1990s,
we used multiport repeaters (hubs) to join multiple "unshielded twisted
pair" (UTP) cabling-system segments. In the latter half of the 1990s,
Ethernet switches made repeaters obsolete.</li>

 <li><b>A multi-port repeater with eavesdrop protection is a
firewall</b>. The harmful thing is the information in the data portion of
the frame (the part of the frame that contains the network-layer packet).
A repeater with "eavesdrop protection" sends the frame intact out the port
that leads to the destination device, but prevents that information from
spreading to other devices by putting garbage in the data portion of the
frame before sending it out the other ports (unless, of course, it is a
multicast frame, which must be repeated intact).
 </li>

 <li><b>A bridge is a firewall</b>. It interconnects two or more
cabling-system segments. The harmful thing is the volume of frames on each
of these cabling-system segments. The bridge prevents unneeded frames from
spreading from one segment to the other segment(s) by ignoring any frame
that is destined for a device that is on the port on which the frame was
received. Otherwise, the frame is transmitted out the port that leads to
the destination device. However, multicast frames must be transmitted out
all other ports.</li>

 <li><b>A switch is a firewall</b>. It is a high-performance multiport
bridge, usually with processing capacity sufficient to move frames between
its "n/2" different pairs of ports at the sum of the physical-layer speeds
of the media connected to those pairs. Some switches only permit a single
device to be connected to a port. Others permit either a single device or
a cabling-system segment to be connected to a port. In either case, the
frame is only sent out the port that leads to the destination device
(unless it is a multicast frame, which must be transmitted to all ports
other than the one from which it was received, or it is a frame destined
for an address not known to the switch, in which case the switch "floods"
the frame to all other ports).</li>

</ul></p>

<h3>At the network layer</h3>
 <p>A device that forwards packets based on IP addresses rather than
transmission-system addresses is referred to herein as a "router".

<ul>

 <li><b>A router is a firewall</b>. It interconnects two or more
otherwise-unconnected transmission systems. Each independent transmission
system forms a "network" that has its own unique network number. The
harmful thing is the volume of frames on the transmission system. The
router prevents unneeded frames from spreading outside their own
transmission system by accepting only those frames that are addressed to
that router port (thus it ignores all transmission-layer multicast frames
as well). The data portion of a frame is the network-layer "packet". The
router extracts the packet's network-layer destination address, consults
its routing table, and gives the packet to the port out which lies the
network containing that destination address; that port puts the packet
into the data portion of a frame and transmits it onto the transmission
system. (If the destination is to a network-layer multicast address, then
the packet has to be copied to its other ports that the router knows lead
to addresses that wish to receive that multicast traffic; how the router
learns about those ports is beyond the intended scope of this
document.)</li>

 <li><b>A router with access-control rules is a firewall</b>. The harmful
thing is some of the sources, destinations, and/or types of packets that
would otherwise pass through the router. The router prevents their spread
by examining each packet received, and testing the various fields in that
packet against a set of organization-determined rules to decide whether to
drop (reject, filter) it or forward (accept, route) that packet.</li>

</ul></p>

<h2><a name="secpra">UW router-firewall security practices</a></h2>

 <p>Implementing effective network security practices requires placing
carefully-chosen constraints on the nature of the traffic that is
considered "safe" to allow into, out of, and through the network. In its
simplest form, this requires proper setting of vendor-provided
configuration options and the use of access-control rules in all of the
campus-backbone routers that interconnect the external network(s) and the
subnets of the internal network. Ideally, those rules should be of the
form "permit things that are safe; deny all else".</p>

<h3>External (between UW and the rest of the world)</h3>
 <p>IST configures options and access-control lists (rules) in UW's
external router to control the packets that enter and leave the campus
network via its external connections. The options and rules reject traffic
types that are known to be significant security liabilities that can be
exploited by external "hackers" attempting to penetrate computers within
the campus network, and activities that impede mission-relevant traffic by
consuming significant shared-resource bandwidth (including
denial-of-service attacks). The list of traffic types to be rejected is
determined in consultation with <a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/CNAG/">CNAG</a> and <a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/CSAG/">CSAG</a>.<p>
 <p>For each IP packet, each rule is tested in succession until a match
occurs. The following is an overview of the rules that are currently in
place.
 <ol>
 <li>deny incoming packets that have a UW subnet-broadcast destination
address</li>
 <li>deny incoming packets that have a multicast, loopback, or RFC1918
(private network) source address</li>
 <li>permit incoming packets for established TCP sessions</li>
 <li>permit incoming packets with multicast destination addresses</li>
 <li>permit incoming BGP routing updates from authorized sources</li>
 <li>permit incoming SNMP and ICMP packets from authorized sources</li>
 <li>deny incoming ICMP "Echo Request" packets (this rejects incoming ping
and traceroute requests) and SNMP packets, deny outgoing ICMP "Echo Reply"
packets</li>
 <li>deny any packet that is an ICMP Redirect or Unreachable, a UDP Echo,
or any of CharGen, Link, lpd, NetBus client/server, NFS, RPC, TFTP, or
UUCP</li>
 <li>deny incoming DNS zone-transfer requests unless destination is one of
UW's internal primaries and source is one of UW's external secondaries</li>
 <li>deny incoming packets that claim to have UW source addresses</li>
 <li>deny outgoing packets that claim to have non-UW source addresses</li>
 <li>deny packets that are any of the protocols known to be used by
music/video file-sharing software (such as Gnutella, KaZaA, Morpheus,
etc)</li>
 <li>permit everything else</li>
 </ol></p>

 <p>The list is reviewed on a regular basis.  Eventually, for at least
some part of the campus network, it will be converted to a "permit only
the small set of assumed-to-be-safe things that are required in support of
UW's mission, deny all else" form, which would prevent every new
not-yet-understood thing from hurting that part of the UW environment.</p>

<h3>Internal (between subnets)</h3>
 <p>The above "external firewalling" does nothing to curtail internal
penetration attempts or shared-resource abuse between machines in the
different subnets of the campus network. IST configures the "core" routers
that interconnect the second-level subnets to activate all available
intrusion-rejection features that do not seriously impede the performance
of the routers. Further work is required in this area. For example, for
some on-campus subnets, we don't need to allow traffic to machines in
those subnets to be initiated from outside those subnets.</p>

<h3>Internal (between machines in the same subnet)</h3>
 <p>Ensuring that all machines in a subnet are wired to switches instead
of shared-access transmission systems (repeaters) prevents one machine
from passively spying on the traffic of the other machines, but it does
not prevent one machine from trying to penetrate or masquerade as another
machine in that same subnet.</p>
 <p>Switches keep getting more sophisticated. Hopefully one day the
transmission systems throughout the campus network will contain only
switches that demand user authentication each time a computer is plugged
in or powered on, and then assign that computer an IP address to use for
the duration and prevent it from using any other IP address. But that
technology isn't routinely available, yet.</p>

<h3>Protecting the sensitive devices in the campus network</h3>
 <p>In the simplest case, this requires internal routers with an
access-control mechanism that <b>permits</b> any communication to be
initiated from any of the sensitive devices in a subnet out into the
campus network and beyond, but <b>denies</b> any attempt to initiate any
communication to the sensitive devices from the campus network or
beyond.</p>
 <p>More complex cases require special access-control measures whose
treatment is beyond the intended scope of this document. Such measures are
under on-going investigation, and include permitting access to certain
subnets and devices only by specifically-authenticated people.</p>

<h3><a name="unauth">Protecting the campus (and beyond) from
unauthenticated-user devices</a></h3>
 <p>There is a growing desire to provide wireless and wired network ports
for "information search and retrieval" workstations and portable devices
(such as laptop computers and personal digital assistants) in all areas of
the campus. From the perspective of security, the provision of such
connections must be regarded as harmful in the extreme.</p>

 <p>Since 1991, the university has imposed administrative regulations on
the nature of the devices that can be connected to any portion of the
campus network (see <a href="netmgmt.html" webstripperlinkwas="netmgmt.html">Network Management
Practices</a> for details). Devices that do not authenticate their users
and are used by multiple people are harmful. For example, they constitute
a launching pad from which someone can anonymously communicate with
malicious intent or from which a "hacker" can anonymously attempt to
penetrate any computer in the campus network and beyond. Therefore, such
devices must be isolated from the campus network and the world by
connecting the harmful devices in a private network behind a firewall
server that performs user authentication and maintains an audit-trail log,
in some fashion.

<ol>

 <li><b>A login/proxy server</b>. The devices have no access to the campus
network and beyond. Each user of each device must communicate with "proxy"
processes running on the server, or must TELNET or RLOGIN to the server
and complete a userid/password login and then use the server as the source
from which to communicate. As far as the campus network and the rest of
the Internet are concerned, the devices do not exist.</li>
 <li><b>An authentication/address server</b>. The server allows traffic
to/from each device to pass through only after the user of the device has
completed a userid/password login and been assigned an IP address. There
must be some counterpart process by which the server detects that the
user's "session" has ended, disallows further traffic to/from that device,
and reclaims the IP address for reassignment. IST has developed a <a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/sy/projects/netauth.html">network-port authentication</a> system
for use in providing network-switch ports for laptop computers, until such
time as such systems become commercially available, and investigation is
underway to provide a comparable user-authentication mechanism for
wireless access. Engineering Computing has developed a more general <a href="http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~bruce/appliances/naa/">Network
Authentication Appliance</a> that should be sufficient in a variety of
lower-volume situations.</li>
 <li><b>By connecting the devices behind a router with an access-control
list that severely constrains the permitted communications to a
deemed-to-be-safe subset of specific application protocols and specific
network destinations</b>. This is the only solution if it is impossible to
authenticate the users of the harmful devices.</li>

</ol></p>

<h2><a name="future">Further work required</a></h2>
 <p>Securing UW's computing and network resources is an on-going task. IST
tracks evolving network and computing-system security technologies
(network-port user authentication, virus and intrusion detection,
firewalls, etc) and deploys them within the campus as dictated by UW
priorities and funding.</p>
