<h1>Coping with the impact of networked residences at the University
of Waterloo</h1>
 <p>2001-12-14</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
 <p>It is essential to understand why the institution exists. That
understanding provides the yardstick by which to measure all things that
are possible, in order to avoid those that do not serve the purpose of the
institution.</p>
 <p>UW's <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infoprov/Planning/final_plan97/f-fulldoc1.html">mission</a>
is to advance learning and knowledge through teaching, research, and
scholarship. UW is not an Internet Service Provider. An ISP is an
organization whose mission is to provide Internet connectivity to other
entities. UW does not provide Internet connectivity to non-UW entities.
UW's computing and network resources are provided so that UW students,
faculty, and staff can pursue their respective activities in support of
UW's mission, as per <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy66.pdf">Policy
66</a> and the <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infocist/use98.htm">Statement on Use of
UW Computing and Network Resources</a>.</p>

 <p>Extending the campus network into the UW and federated/affiliated
college residences was one of the responses to UW's 1998 objective of
enabling high-speed connectivity from the campus network into the homes of
UW students, faculty, and staff (see the <i>Teaching and Learning</i>
section of the <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infocist/Directions1998.html">1998
Directions Statement</a> published by <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infocist/">UCIST</a>).</p>

 <p>The <a href="http://www.ist.uwaterloo.ca/cn/">campus network and its
external connections</a> are resources that must be shared and used
appropriately by UW's community of 25,000 students, faculty, and staff. In
the absence of unlimited bandwidth at zero cost, every member of the UW
community has a responsibility to participate in managing utilization of
these shared resources to ensure that
 <ul>
 <li>use that is not related to UW's mission does not impact on the
availability of a resource for use that is, and</li>
 <li>any need to increase the capacity of a resource is due to the
growth of mission-relevant use.</li>
 </ul>
 </p>

<h2>History of modifications</h2>

 <p>Since the introduction of ResNet in the Fall Term of 1997, <a href="http://www.ist.uwaterloo.ca/">IST</a> has been pursuing mechanisms
to cope with the impact of the growing number of network connections in
the campus residences by placing per-resident limits on volume, rather
than trying to constrain access based on issues such as "content".
 <table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3">
 <tr><td valign="top">1998-01-01</td><td>Introduced per-day and
term-to-date <b>limits on external traffic</b>, to deal with excessive use

 <tr><td valign="top">2000-08-25</td><td>Changed <u>from</u> limits on
external traffic <u>to</u> <b>limits on campus+external traffic</b>, to

traffic.</td></tr>

 <tr><td valign="top">2001-01-02</td><td>Those who exceed a limit are
placed in the constrained-bandwidth queue only during peak-hours periods,

 <tr><td valign="top">2001-04-24</td><td>The term-to-date (3000MB) and

exceeding the 300MB limit were reduced by 13%, from a total of 102 hours
per week to a total of 89 hours per week (an increase of 20% in the number
of non-constraint hours).</td></tr> 
 <tr><td valign="top">2001-11-23</td><td>The "300MB in last 7 days" limit

 </table></p>

<h2>The technology</h2>

<h3>Topology</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>Each residence-room outlet in the campus network is connected via
Cat5 UTP to a 10Mbps port in a stack of two or three Cisco Catalyst 1900
Ethernet switches that are locally interconnected via 100Mbps UTP
ports.</li>
 <li>Each switch stack has a 100Mbps fibre uplink to a residence-centric
Catalyst 5505 switch, which has a 100Mbps fibre uplink to a C5505 core
switch.</li>
 <li>Each residence-centric C5505 contains a Route Switch Module (ie, a
router).</li>
 </ul></p>
 <p><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Residence/v1.gif"></p>
 <p><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Residence/cmr.gif"></p>
 <p><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Residence/uwp.gif"></p>
 <p><img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Residence/facmh.gif"></p>

<h3>Address administration</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>We configure the switch ports to allow only one Ethernet address, and
to learn and "lock in" first Ethernet address seen on the port.</li>
 <li>We permanently assign an IP address corresponding to each
residence-room switch port.</li>
 <li>We use DHCP to map the Ethernet address to the assigned IP address.
 <li>We configure each residence router to run with a static ARP table of
IP/Ethernet addresses.</li>
 </ul></p>

 <p>When we started in the Fall term of 1997, each residence
administration had to collect and report to us each resident's Ethernet
address, by switch/port, at the start of the term. For the start of the
Fall term of 2000, we developed a Perl program that uses SNMP to get the
Ethernet address connected to each switch port and generate the DHCP
entries and the routers' ARP-table entries from that.</p>

<h3>Traffic analysis</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>We use the IP ACCOUNTING feature in Cisco's
IOS to gather traffic data (source IP, destination IP, packets,
bytes) from the router that connects the residence network to the
campus.</li>
 <li>We process that data via various Perl programs to track and report <a href="http://noc.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Stats/resReport">campus+external use</a>
by each resident.</li>
 </ul></p>

<h2>The impact</h2>

<h3>Fall 1997</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>We added the first 680 ports in V1, one of the residences
administered by the UW Housing department.</li>
 <li>The cost to Housing for the cabling plus switches was about $290 per
residence-room connection.</li>
 <li>Housing charged $50 per four-month term, if the resident wanted the
connection activated.</li>
 <li>The "take" rate was about 50%.</li>
 <li>We activated the service in October. By November, consumption of UW's
external bandwidth had more than doubled.</li>
 </ul>
 <img webstripperattrwas="src" webstripperlinkwas="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Stats/extvol.gif">
 </p>

<h3>Winter 1998</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>We began an process of informing the residence administration each
time a resident showed up in the daily "top hogs" list of those causing
more than 1% of the total consumption of the external link.</li>
 <li>The residence administration contacted and warned the resident.</li>
 <li>On the third instance, we added an access-list filter in the
residence router to block off-campus traffic to/from the resident's IP
address ("confined to campus").</li>
 <li>To get the confinement removed, the resident had to go plead with
the Associate Dean of Computing for the faculty in which the resident was
registered as a student.</li>
 <li>Once the ADC got annoyed of excuses and said "no", the resident's
connection remained confined to campus for the rest of the term.</li>
 <li>The process greatly annoyed the small minority of students who felt
no obligation to confine their use to university-intended purposes.</li>
 <li>The process also greatly annoyed the ADCs, the residence
administration, and us. We began to contemplate ways to automate the
process.</li>
 <li>And, some small number of enterprising residents quitely began to use
one faculty's HTTP proxy server to "tunnel" their off-campus
traffic.</li>
 </ul></p>

<h3>Fall 1998</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>The number of residence connections increased from 680 to 1500.</li>
 <li>The annoying aspects of the process got much more annoying.</li>
 <li>We started implementation for a fully-automated system of <a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/directives/w99rn-excess.html">limits</a>, by adding a few more Perl
programs to the suite.</li>
 </ul></p>

<h3>Winter 1999</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>We instituted the automated system of limits ... max 2500MB per term,
max 25MB term-to-date daily average, and max 150MB per day. Data showed
that 85% of the residents were under those limits.</li>
 <li>Exceeding the max-per-day limit resulted in confinement to campus for
the rest of the day.</li>
 <li>Exceeding the term-to-date daily average lowered the max-per-day
limit to 15MB for as long as it took the daily average to fall below 25MB
again.</li>
 <li>Exceeding the term limit lowered the max-per-day limit for the rest
of the term.</li>
 <li>IP ACCOUNTING data collected, analyzed, updated every 12
minutes.</li>
 <li>No more annoyances to ADCs, residence administrators, or us.</li>
 <li>The portion of external traffic attributable to residence connections
fell to 20%.</li>
 <li>We started to get complaints from some good-citizen residents about
the bad-citizen residents who were using the unrestricted on-campus HTTP
proxy server to "tunnel" their off-campus downloads.</li>
 </ul></p>

<h3>Fall 1999</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>Residence connections went from 1500 to 1800.</li>
 <li>The "take" rate went up to about 65%.</li>
 </ul></p>

<h3>Winter 2000</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>The "take" rate was up to about 70%.</li>
 <li>The prominence of Napster exposed the fact that lots of bad-citizen
residents were using the unrestricted on-campus HTTP proxy server to
"tunnel" their off-campus traffic.</li>
 <li>Our first venture in to QoS mechanisms was an experiment with the
Cisco IOS "Committed Access Rate" (CAR) to constrain residence traffic to
2Mbps. Brutally effective. We want a kinder gentler mechanism that only
attacks those who are trying to consume the most.</li>
 <li>We started doing IP ACCOUNTING at the residence routers and tracking
the total on-campus and external traffic by resident.</li>
 <li>Total external use caused by residents, as a result of "tunneling"
through on-campus systems, was almost four times that detected at the
external router ... approaching 60% of the external traffic.</li>
 <li>The faculty that owned the proxy server asked us to prevent its use
from residence connections.</li>
 <li>Total traffic attributable to the residence connections immediately
dropped, to only about twice what was being detected at the external
router (ie, some residents were using other tunneling targets and
techniques).</li>
 </ul>

 </p>

<h3>Spring 2000</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>An external-traffic report in the middle of the term ...
 <pre>
2000-06-21 residence external traffic
average 12 MBpd, 808 users, 51 days

MBpd      N  cumN        cum%N    cum%V    aMBpd
-----  ----  ----------  -------  -------  -----
<5 201 201 607 24 76 2 98 1 < 10 139 340 468 42 58 12 88 3 < 15 130 470 338 58 42 28 72 6 < 20 136 606 202 75 25 52 48 8 < 25 135 741 67 91 9 82 18 11 < 30 66 807 1 99 1 99 1 12 < 35 1 808 0 100 0 99 1 12 </pre></li>
 <li>We redid the automated system to limit <a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/directives/rn-excess.html">campus+external</a> per-resident
traffic, for implementation starting Fall 2000.</li>
 <li>3000MB per term, max 30MB term-to-date daily average.</li>
 <li>Again, based on data that showed that 85% of the residents used less
than that.
<pre>
2000-06-21 residence campus+external traffic
21GB/day, 715 users, average 30MB/day

MBpd      N  cumN        cum%N    cum%V    aMBpd

</pre></li>
 <li>A number of academic units are preparing to experiment with
instructional video-on-demand distribution servers. The new system of
residence-traffic limiting therefore has a list of on-campus IP
addresses that are exempt from counted traffic.</li>
 <li>We developed a set of <a href="http://noc.uwaterloo.ca/cn/resnet/">web-based tools</a> by which the
residence administrator can (after <a href="#idauth">authenticating</a>)
query a resident's usage counters and display/alter the status of certain
switch/port settings in that residence, including to clear the learned
Ethernet address from a port or disable/enable the port. It is a few Perl
programs that do SNMP "get" and "set" operations. (It has also been
expanded into a more general-purpose tool that will enable specific
individuals to display and alter various port parameters on various
switches.)</li>
 <li>One of these programs allows the residence-network administrator to
automatically clear all the learned Ethernet addresses from all the
residence switches at the end of each term, so that the switches will
acquire the newly-learned Ethernet addresses at the the beginning of next
term.</li>
 </ul></p>

<h3>Fall 2000 -- constrain, not confine</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>Residence connections went from 1800 to 2400 ... that's the half-way
point for the existing plus currently-planned new residences. The
"subscription rate" was 2010, or 84%. As of the end of the Fall-term
lecture period on December 4,
  <ul>
  <li>94% of the residents were under the 30MB daily-average limit,</li>
  <li>45% had never exceeded their daily-max limit, and another 46% had
been in a limit-exceeded state less than 5% of the time,</li>
  <li>total time confined was 1.5% of user-days total, and</li>
  <li>on-campus traffic was 5.3% of campus+external total.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
 <li>On December 5, we began putting those residents who have exceeded
their limit for the day into contention for a constrained low-bandwidth
pipe (64Kbps) between the residence router and the campus for the rest of
that day, rather than cutting off their entire campus+external access for
the rest of that day. That bandwidth is sufficient only to allow them to
continue with small text-based applications such as reading/sending mail,
reading/posting course newsgroups, and retrieving assignment details from
course webservers. Over the course of a day, as the number of users in
contention grows, being constrained becomes less and less pleasant.</li>
 </ul></p>

<h3>Winter 2001 -- "last 10 days" limits</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>At the start of the term, we began applying the constraint only
during "peak hours" periods, which we defined as 0800-2300 Monday through
Thursday, 0800-1800 Friday, 1200-1800 Saturday, and 1200-2300 Sunday.
Traffic is counted throughout the entire day, but the consequence of being
in the limit-exceeded state is applied only during the peak-hours periods.
Outside those periods, usage is not limited.</li>
 <li>It took less than five weeks for a very small minority (2%) of the
residents to prove that they were capable of consuming all available
external bandwidth outside the peak-hours periods. To curtail this
"conspicuous consumption" before the very small minority grew any larger,
we introduced a last-10-days limit of 1500MB and put those who exceeded it
into the constrained-bandwidth queue even outside the peak-hours
periods.</li>
 <li>At the end of the term, we replaced the "3000MB since start of term"
and "30MB daily average" limits with a "300MB in last 10 days" limit.</li>
 </ul></p>

<h3>Spring 2001 -- QoS considerations</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>Starting 2001-06-25, we activated Class-Based Weighted Fair Queuing
with Weighted Random Early Detection on the external-links router, to
provide "guaranteed minimum bandwidth" for the residence networks and the
rest of the campus, based on the percent that the ResNet users represent
of the entire campus.</li>
 <li>But we are keeping the per-resident limits and constraints in place
until we are confident that we understand the extent to which CBWFQ/WRED
is effective.</li>
 </ul></p>

<h3>Fall 2001 -- guaranteed minimum bandwidth</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>Effective 2001-09-01, the residence administrations provided funding
to increase UW's external bandwidth by 20%, thus raising ResNet's minimum
guaranteed share from 22% of 20Mbps to 35% of 24Mbps for the Fall 2001
term.</li>
 <li>On 2001-10-07, after having had sufficient time to confirm that
CB-WFQ/WRED was indeed having the expected effect, the limits were
increased by changing the last-N-days period from 10 to 7, and the hours
of constraint for exceeding the 300MB limit were reduced by.</li>
 <li>On 2001-11-23, the "300MB in last 7 days" limit was increased to
"500MB in last 7 days".</li>
 </ul>
 The CB-WFQ/WRED algorithms have proven very effective during weekday
hours, as shown by the following daily-summary report.</p>
 <pre>2001-12-06 ResNet consumption of external bandwidth

<h3>Winter 2002 -- ???</h3>

<h2>Resource-management alternatives</h2>

<h3>Alternatives considered and rejected</h3>
 <p>The following do not enable alternate means of connecting computers in
residences to the campus network. However, achieving the bandwidth-control
objective they represent is a necessary prior condition to pursuing
alternate means of connection.</p>
 <ul>
 <li><b>Provide residence connectivity via some ISP</b>. This would
require obtaining non-UW IP network numbers for the residence networks. It
has the advantage of removing 95% of residence traffic from contention for
UW resources, but it also has several significant disadvantages. It is not
likely to be a wise use of money&nbsp;... provisioning for the required
bandwidth (Bell via HSE, Rogers via @Home, or some other Internet Service
Provider with a KW presence) will be more expensive per total Mbps than
the significant discount that ONet Networking obtains for its Toronto
general-Internet connections to its national/international ISPs because
the aggregate general-Internet subscribed bandwidth of ONet's members is
measured in the hundreds of Mbps. Also, for the 5% of residence traffic
that is with on-campus systems, unless that ISP is willing to provide a
direct <a href="../local.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/local.html">local</a> connection of its network to the
UW network, this will cause routing of campus/residence packets through an
added chain of local/regional/national ISPs; the resulting packet latency
and discard rates will be worse by factors measured in tens to a hundred.
This goes in the exact opposite direction to preparing for an environment
in which connectivity with on-campus systems will increase as the
web-interface student information system unfolds over the next year and
higher-bandwidth "teaching and learning" multi-media servers and services
are developed.</li>
 <li><b>Route the external residence traffic through an ISP and the UW
traffic via the campus network</b>. This would also require obtaining
non-UW IP network numbers for the residence networks. It does not address
the higher cost of the ISP external bandwidth. Also, it perpetuates the
existing complexity to deal with residents using on-campus systems to
tunnel their off-campus traffic.</li>
 <li><b>Provide separate ONet external bandwidth for ResNet users</b>. For
the immediate future only, it is possible to do this over the ATM circuits
used by ONet Networking, but there are significant disadvantages&nbsp;...
unused capacity in the ResNet-dedicated circuit would not be available to
the rest of the campus, unused capacity in the non-ResNet circuit would
not be available to ResNet users, it does not eliminate the "tunnel
through on-campus systems" problem, and the ATM connection to ONet will be
abandoned in favour of a Gigabit EtherNet connection to the ORION "Optical
IP" network that will replace the ONet network sometime in 2002.
 <li><b>Impose a maximum-bandwidth cap on ONet external bandwidth for
ResNet users</b>. This is a variation of "provide separate ONet bandwidth"
above. It has the same disadvantage that unused non-ResNet capacity would
not be available to ResNet users, and it does not eliminate the
"tunnel" problem.</li>
 </ul>

<h3>The alternative chosen</h3>
 <p>To reduce the complexity of meeting resource-management obligations,
an approach is required that involves IP bandwidth allocation, fair-share
queuing, and packet-priorization mechanisms. These are collectively
referred to as IP "Quality of Service" (QoS) mechanisms. This does not
eliminate the "tunnel" problem, but it is the best approach to the rest of
the problems.
 <ul>
 <li><b>Provide a guaranteed minimum ONet external bandwidth for ResNet
users</b>. This can be done using IP bandwidth-apportioning features of
the UW router and the ONet router at the Waterloo and Toronto ends of UW's
ONet link.</li>
 </ul>
 </p>

 <p>The approach is to set a basic minimum guarantee equal to the percent
that ResNet users represent of the total UW population. It is possible for
the residence administrations to provide IST with funds for additional
bandwidth to increase the ResNet guaranteed minimum.</p>

 <p>It is necessary to maintain essential aspects of the current <a href="rn-excess.html" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/Residence/rn-excess.html">limits</a> mechanism, to address the
"tunnel through on-campus systems" problem and to constrain unreasonably
excessive use.</p>

<h3>Identification and authentication mechanisms</h3>
 <p><ul>
 <li>UW's on-line campus directory, <a name="idauth" href="http://ego.uwaterloo.ca/~uwdir/">UWdir</a>, has been in place since
the early 1990s.</li>
 <li>In 1999, we augmented this identification system with a
userid/password authentication system using a Windows NT Domain Controller
database.</li>
 <li>In 2000, we developed a <a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/sy/projects/">network-port
authentication</a> mechanism that uses the campus-directory authentication
system. This enables us to deploy network ports for portable or desktop
computers, anywhere on campus ("we can even wire the trees"). It also
permits the resident with a portable computer to use one of those
connections, and still enables us to apply the per-resident limits to that
resident.</li>
 <li>Perhaps we'll abandon the residence address-assignment process in
favour of the port-authentication process, if we can modify the system of
per-resident limits to be keyed by userid rather than IP address.</li>
