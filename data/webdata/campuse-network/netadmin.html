<h2><a name="structure">Management structure</a></h2>

 <h3>AP-IST and UCIST</h3>
 <p>Authority for the formation of policy for UW's network and computing
resources belongs to the Associate Provost, Information Systems and
Technology (AP-IST), in consultation with <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infocist/">UCIST</a>, the University
Committee on Information Systems and Technology.</p>

 <h3><a name="CNAG">Campus Networks Advisory Group</a></h3>
 <p><a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/CNAG/">CNAG</a> exists to make recommendation to UCIST on
the evolution of facilities, services, procedures and policies for the
campus network, to facilitate communication and interaction among the
various computing-support areas on campus, and to help coordinate decision
making on related campus-wide issues.</p>

 <h3>Information Systems and Technology</h3>
 <p><a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/">IST</a> has responsibility for the campus network and
related communications facilities within established practices. These
include the planning, design, installation, operation, and administration
of the campus backbone (level-one) network and its transmission systems
and backbone and building-point-of-presence switching and routing devices,
the connection of external networks and level-two networks to the
level-one network, the routing of traffic over the level-one network, the
assignment of network names and addresses, and the central
network-administration servers and services.</p>

 <h3>Academic and Academic-Support units</h3>
 <p>In the academic-support sector (and in the academic sector, where
requested), IST provides design, installation, and administration of the
corridor and corridor-to-office transmission systems that comprise the
various level-two networks, and the connection of devices to those
transmission systems. In each Faculty, some or all of the responsibility
for these functions is handled by the Faculty's computing-office staff
under the authority of the Associate Dean of Computing.</p>

<h2><a name="practices">Established practices</a></h2>

 <h3>Cabling-system installation</h3>
 <p>All cabling and installation work must meet the UW-established <a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/ps/comm/documents/Cabling_Guidelines/Cable_Plant_Procedures_and_Guidlines.htm">
specifications</a>.</p>

 <h3>Names and numbers</h3>
 <p>For the purposes of communication within the campus network and with
the rest of the worldwide Internet community, UW's official "electronic
identity" consists of the Internet network number "129.97.0.0" and the
Internet domain name "uwaterloo.ca". These are UW resources administered
by IST.</p>

 <h3><a name="aup">Acceptable Use</a></h3>
 <p>Traffic transmitted over the campus network and its external
connection(s) must be in compliance with University-established policies,
<a href="http://ist.uwaterloo.ca/directives/">directives</a>, procedures, and conditions as
exemplified by the <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infocist/use98.htm">Statement on Use of
UW Computing and Network Resources</a>, this document, and any agreements
between the University and external entities administering resources to
which the campus network is connected. Examples of the latter include the
ONet Networking corporations's <a href="http://www.onet.on.ca/Membership_Information/Terms_and_Conditions.html">
membership terms and conditions</a>. The administrative entity serviced by
a level-two network has authority to establish additional acceptable-use
conditions for traffic that originates and terminates solely within that
level-two network and its lower-level networks.</p>

 <h3><a name="trust">Trusted and untrusted devices</a></h3>
 <p>A device is deemed to be <b>trusted</b> if its network connection is
via a mechanism that identifies the person who will be held accountable
for a specific instance of its use, and that mechanism is under the
control of a UW department with employees responsible for dealing with
misuse. Examples include:
 <ol>
 <li>a device that isolates the user from the network so that the user
must first login through an "authentication" server before being able to
use the network to communicate with anything else, and the server keeps an
audit-trail log;</li>
 <li>a device that is connected to the campus network via a <a href="../Residence" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/Residence" />UW ResNet</a> residence-room connection;</li>
 <li>a device in an individual's private office and intended for that
individual's use exclusively.</li>
 </ol>
 Otherwise, the device is deemed to be <b>untrusted</b> and may not be
connected unless its functioning has been so severely constrained that it
can be used only to communicate with specific "information server" devices
in the campus network or beyond, and only in the ways intended by the
providers of those servers. Incidents of misuse from the device will
require its removal from the network until it can be reconnected in a
"trusted" manner.
 </ol></p>

<h2><a name="operation">IST campus-network administration</a></h2>
 <h3>Attachment points</h3>
 <p>IST provides a port on a switch or router on the level-one network as
the point of attachment for the external network links and each level-two
network. These switches and routers are protected by UPS equipment
providing clean power and battery backup sufficient to protect against
short-duration power outages.</p>
 <h3>Network monitoring</h3>
 <p>IST monitors selected devices in the level-one and level-two networks
to detect loss-of-connectivity troubles as they occur. Information on
scheduled outages and problem resolutions is posted to the "uw.network"
newsgroup. Similar notifications from the ONet Networking operation centre
and beyond are automatically posted to this newsgroup if they contain the
string "waterloo". Other notifications are posted to the
"uw.network.external" newsgroup. IST collects <a href="../index.html#Stats" webstripperlinkwas="/cn/#Stats">network-utilization data</a> for the switches and
routers that interconnect the external and level-two networks to the
level-one network. Daily and monthly reports are posted to the
"uw.network.stats" newsgroup.</p>
 <h3><a name="requests">Requests for network numbers and domain
addresses</a></h3>
 <p>UW's IP subnet numbers and IP addresses are a finite resource.
Assignments of specific numbers cannot be guaranteed to be permanent. To
minimize the need for manual renumbering in instances where
currently-assigned numbers must be changed, those who are responsible for
network-connected devices should configure those devices to obtain their
IST-assigned IP address via the campus DHCP service.
 <ul>
 <li><b><a name="subnet">Request for IP subnet number<a/></b>. The
creation of a new level-two or lower-level network requires that IST
assign an IP subnet number to the new network. Any organizational unit
contemplating a new subnet is advised to contact its <a href="#CNAG" webstripperlinkwas="netadmin.html#CNAG">CNAG</a> representative. There is a finite
supply of IP subnet numbers, so a new subnet number will not be assigned
unless the request is the result of an existing subnet having grown to the
point where more than 90% of the available addresses are in <a href="http://noc.uwaterloo.ca/cn/Stats/netsize/report">active use</a>, or
unless both the CNAG representative and IST's Manager of Network Systems
Integration agree that there is some special technical condition for which
there is no solution other than assigning a new subnet.</li>
 <li><b>Request for IP address and device connection</b>. When IST
receives a request to install a cabling-system connection and/or assign an
IP address to the device that is to use that connection, we first obtain
confirmation from the CNAG representative before proceeding.</li>
 <li><b>Non-UW network numbers</b>. An organizational unit should not
attempt to obtain its own IP network number. For security reasons, the
only traffic permitted through the campus-network external connection is
traffic that is destined to or originating from an IP address within the
subnets of UW's IP network number. There are situations in which the
objective is to create a lower-level network that will be invisible within
and external to the campus network. <a href="rfc1918" webstripperlinkwas="rfc1918">RFC1918</a> provides
a set of Class A, Class B, and Class C network numbers that may be used
for this purpose.</li>
 <li><b>Request for webserver addresses</b>. IST will accept a request for
a domain-name address such as "www.XXXXX.uwaterloo.ca" pointing to a
webserver computer provided that:
  <ul>
  <li>the requested "XXXXX" clearly and unambiguously designates a UW
organizational unit (faculty, department, group, or federated/affiliated
college), or a project of such an organizational unit, and</li>
  <li>the request is submitted to IST with confirmation from the entity
that has administrative authority for the computer that will house the
corresponding web material.</li>
  </ul>
  Any situation in which UW sponsorship is not clear will be referred by
IST to the relevant member of CNAG or UCIST for guidance.</li>
 <li><b>Personal-webspace addresses</b>. To enable a simple form of
addressing for the personal homepage for UW faculty, staff, and students,
a facility exists that will redirect a URL of the form
"http://uwaterloo.ca/~uwuserid/" (where "uwuserid" is your UWdir userid)  
to the URL of your choice. You activate this by adding that URL to your
UWdir entry. To do this, see the "SignOn with UWdir" and "Update Your
UWdir Data" documents at <a href="http://ego.uwaterloo.ca/~uwdir/">UWdir
and Authentication Services</a>.</li>
 <li><b>Request to facilitate non-UW domain-name addresses</b>. IST will
accept a request to provide limited Domain Name System service for a
non-UW domain provided that:
  <ul>
  <li>the non-UW domain represents some external collective entity in
which a UW organizational unit is clearly an on-going participant in
support of a UW research, instructional, or administrative function,</li>
  <li>the purpose of the request is to enable the UW organizational unit
to house information for the non-UW entity on a UW computer (eg, a
webserver) because the non-UW entity is incapable of having its own
facilities, and</li>
  <li>the request from the UW organizational unit is accompanied by
confirmation from the non-UW entity and confirmation from the UW entity
that has administrative authority for the computer that will house the
information.</li>
  </ul>
  Any situation in which UW sponsorship is not clear will be referred by
IST to the relevant member of CNAG or UCIST for guidance.</li>
 </ul>
