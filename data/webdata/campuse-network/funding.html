<h2>Canada/Ontario Infrastructure Works Program</h2>
 <p>Phase one of the network upgrades occurred with $675K assistance from
the COIWP, earmarked, approximately equally, to three categories: 
 <ul>
 <p><li>core renovations ... the nine-node backbone of switching/routing
equipment
 <p><li>workgroup renovations ... a "building point of presence" workgroup
switch for each building (more than one for each of Math and Engineering) 
 <p><li>wiring renovations ... replacement of coax by Category 5 UTP,
and replacement of pre-Cat5 UTP
 </ul>

<h2>Bell Emergis University Labs</h2>
 <p>Some significant portion of Bell's $9M funding for UW's participation
in its Waterloo lab will be applied to network-infrastructure upgrades in
the ICR research units, primarily in DC.

<h2>Canada Foundation for Innovation, Ontario Research and Development
Challenge Fund</h2>
 <p>Phase two of the network upgrades, for the rest of the academic
sector, will occur over the period 1999-2002 with the assistance of $1.4M
from CFI and ORDCF.
