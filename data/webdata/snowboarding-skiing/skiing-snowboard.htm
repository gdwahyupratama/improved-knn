<font SIZE=3>

Canada offers affordable, first class skiing and snowboarding in hundreds of ski areas across



the country, most of them easily accessible from major cities.

<p>









The season runs from mid November to late May. In addition to downhill skiing and



snowboarding, most of the resorts offer other options, such as marked nordic ski trails, 



snowshoe touring, heliskiing, para skiing, dogsledding, snowmobiles and other winter fun.

<P>In the quest to triumph over snowy mountain and hill, Canada is home



to some of the best skiers in the world...and a series of excellent resorts.



In British Columbia, just 90 minutes drive north of Vancouver, the wide



open trails of Whistler and Blackcomb will satisfy the most demanding of



skiers. They are the two greatest vertical-rise ski mountains in North America



and offer the largest expanse of skiable terrain in Canada with more than



200 trails, 12 massive bowls including three glaciers. There are also some



brilliant, lesser-known resorts in British Columbia's interior, such as



Big White, Silver Star, Apex, Fernie Snow Valley, Panorama and Sun Peaks.



Calgary, site of the 1988 Winter Olympics, is gateway to many world-class



ski resorts, including Sunshine with its wide-open alpine meadows, Lake



Louise with its fabulous views, and the more recently built facilities at



Kananaskis. In the east, the fabled resorts of Mont Tremblant and Mont Sainte-Anne



offer downhill challenges to both novice and expert, along with the cuisine



and apres-ski for which Quebec is famous. Marble Mountain, in Newfoundland,



extends Canada's great skiing all the way to the East Coast.</P>

<B>Whistler:</B> Just 121 km north of Vancouver, Whistler Resort has the most extensive



     lift system in the world, the greatest vertical rise in North America, and two separate



     skiing mountains, Whistler and Blackcomb. There are more than 200 marked trails,



     and 12 massive alpine bowls including three glaciers. Each mountain has a snowboard



     park. As it is close to the coast, temperatures remain moderate, with excellent



     snowfalls. Whistler is in a class by itself, rated the Number One Ski Resort in North



     America by every U.S. ski magazine this year.<BR>



<P>







<B> Okanagan:</B>  This popular region is just a 4 to 5 hour drive from



     Vancouver, or you can fly to into Kelowna from Vancouver.  The resorts hear boast



     huge, dependable snow falls of featherlight powder. It's home to several charming



     and challenging resorts, including: <BR>





     - Big White - the second largest ski resort in British Columbia and a great family



     mountain.  There are over 100 groomed trails on incredibly scenic terrain. 

<BR>







     - Silver Star - great family skiing right from the village as well as challenging expert



     runs in the Valley of Adventure.  Silver Star is known for its charming Klondike-era



     gold miners' "gaslight village" theme.

<BR>







     - Apex Alpine - Great terrain, lots of dry powder snow and plenty of sunshine makes



     for a great  experience.  A small, friendly resort with a western ranch theme.<BR>















     - Sun Peaks, just 53 km north of Kamloops, has just undergone



     a major expansion. It's famous for its dry powder skiing, wide open slopes, huge



     bowls and beautiful treed glades.  It offers one of Canada's largest snowboard parks.

Panorama</B> is nestled amidst the peaks of the Purcell Range into the British Columbia



     Rockies, just two hours drive from Calgary.  With the second highest  vertical in



     Canada after Whistler, it's a great family resort with long, well-groomed runs perfect



     for exciting cruising.  Its School of Skiing is ranked first in Canada by Ski Canada



     Magazine.   There is a new Extreme Dream Zone and heli-skiing facility.





<P>





<B>Fernie Snow Valley Resort</B> and <B>Kimberley Ski Resort</B> are also in the B.C. Rockies.



     Fernie, an hour from Cranbrook airport, or a three hour drive from Calgary, has



     plenty of steep terrain.  Powder adventure seekers can try out two snowcat skiing



     operations in the area.  Kimberley, 15 minutes from Cranbrook, has two snowboard



     parks.  The town has a memorable Bavarian style ambiance and architecture. <BR>

<ol><li> Banff/Lake Louise is in one of the world's most beautiful national parks. You can



     stay at either resort town and use a tri-area pass to ski three great ski fields :

<BR><BR>







     - Mystic Ridge and Norquay - a compact valley with a variety of easily-accessed



     runs just 10 minutes from Banff.

<P>







     - Lake Louise - Considered by many to have the most breathtaking alpine scenery



     of any mountain resort in North America, Lake Louise sprawls across two mountain



     faces and offers some of the best skiing and snowboarding in the Rocky Mountains.

     - Sunshine Village - just 20 minutes from Banff, and right on the Continental Divide,



     Sunshine received a phenomenal 17 metres of snow last year.  Since adding a third



     mountain to its resort, Sunshine now offers 360 degrees of great skiing terrain.

<li>2. Kananaskis Country, site of the 1988 Winter Olympics, is a base for downhill skiing



     at Nakiska and Fortress Mountain, and cross country at the Canmore Nordic Centre. 





</li>

<P>



<li>Marmot Basin; just a 20 minute drive from the town of Jasper. The skiing's great,

Heading east? Quebec is home to many fine ski resorts. Here are two of the best known.

<P>





<img src="../images/023.jpg" ALIGN="left"



NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="142" height="190">



<ol><li>Mont Tremblant, just north of Montreal, has been named the top-ranked ski resort



     in eastern North America by SKI Magazine.  Since its purchase by Intrawest (the



     same developers at Whistler Resort), it has expanded tremendously and now offers



     74 runs and two snowboarding parks.  The unique Quebecois style village nestled at



     the base of the mountain on the shores of Lac Tremblant is famous for its great apres-



     ski atmosphere.





</li>

<P>

<li>Mont-Sainte-Anne, just 30 minutes drive from Quebec City, offers the unique



     advantage of being a complete winter sports destination just a short drive from one



     of the most enchanting and historic cities in North America.  As well as downhill



     skiing there's a massive snowboard park, dogsledding, snowshoeing, iceskating,



     snowmobiling and paragliding.</li></ol>

<P>The rugged and the refined both await the adventurous traveller



who penetrates Canada's heartland. Superb terrain, accommodations, and equipment



are all here: skiers are invited to enter a world that still offers challenges,



natural scenery, and unspoiled landscapes.</P>







<P>British Columbia and Alberta offer a thrilling variety



of terrains, especially in Rocky Mountain national and provincial parks.



With excellent snow conditions and numerous resorts, they have been Canada's



premier vacation destinations for years. Saskatchewan's Prince Albert National



Park, 230 kilometres north of Saskatoon, is a cross-country skier's paradise.



This vast tract of wilderness is replete with one of the greatest wildlife



populations in Canada: wild bison, black bears, coyotes, moose, caribou,



wolves, and eagles thrive here.</P>







<P>In Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada, cross country



skiing is a well-established family activity. Extensive networks of cross-country



trails, many close to urban centres, lead to a backcountry dotted with comfortable



chalets and charming inns.</P>







<P>Seasoned skiers favouring long-distance treks will find



much in Quebec's varied geography to test their stamina and endurance, particularly



in Quebec's rugged Chic-Choc Mountains.</P>







<P>The Atlantic province of Nova Scotia is blessed with an



abundance of undisturbed natural areas. Weaving gently through the woodlands,



the highlands, and the open fields of Nova Scotia are more than 2,500 km



of new trails.</P>







<P>From December through April, these areas are well-maintained



playgrounds for cross-country skiers. In February the patchwork vista of



the Annapolis Valley is the setting for the Sheffield Mills Eagle Watch.</P>







<P>Over 200 breeding pairs of bald eagles make Nova Scotia



their home. Charming country homes and bed & breakfasts provide comfort,



convenience, and old-fashioned Nova Scotian hospitality for your winter



holiday. The tranquil woodlands and winter wonderland are just steps from



your back door.
