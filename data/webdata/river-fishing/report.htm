  <LI> <I><FONT SIZE=+2>Lower Rogue (Gold Beach to Agness)</FONT></I></LI>

  <BR>

 Fishing on the lower Rogue River  for winter steelhead, until just recently was excellent.  The recent rains have caused the river to get "out of shape".   As soon as the river drops and clears the fishing should be excellent.    <BR>

  <BR>

Fishing for Winter Steelhead in the Grants Pass area has just begun.  Most of the fishing being reported are comming from the Galice area where the fishing has been good to excellent.  The river is currently out of shape but this should change by the weekend if we don't have any more rain.
