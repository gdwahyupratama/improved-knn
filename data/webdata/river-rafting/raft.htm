<P>Red Canyon River Trips takes pride in having the most experienced guides on the Shoshone River.  With 27 years of <A HREF="history.html">history</A> on the Shoshone, our professional river guides are dedicated to offering a quality adventure full of fun and excitement, always with your safety as their priority.  Sharing their knowledge and expertise about the river and its surroundings is an important part of all our trips.
<IMG SRC="image/raft.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=333 HEIGHT=360 HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5><P>Cody Country is rich in history and our boatmen take pleasure in sharing it with you.  You'll travel through time,  back to the days of mountain men, Native Americans and outlaws.
<P>We at Red Canyon River Trips take pride in our honesty and integrity.  When we say that you will have a whitewater experience of a set distance, that is exactly what we give you.  We believe that you should get every foot of whitewater you pay for ... no exceptions!  Unfortunately this is not always the case with all river float companies.  We feel that it is important for companies to provide you with the exact mileage you will be traveling.  We at Red Canyon have accurate maps available for you to check before choosing your river route.  Please feel free to stop in and compare or just say "Howdy."
