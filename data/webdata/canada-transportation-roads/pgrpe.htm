<h3>What is PGRP?</H3>

The Prairie Grain Roads Program is a $175 million federal initiative established to improve municipal
grain roads and provincial secondary highways. Traffic on these essential roads has increased as a
result of changing transportation policies and the restructuring of grain handling systems.

<h3>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES</h3>

To provide Government of Canada assistance to upgrade some of the municipal roads and secondary
provincial highways used for the transportation of grain in the Prairie provinces
and the Peace River region of British Columbia.


<h3>WHO CAN APPLY?</h3>

     <UL>
<LI> Rural and urban municipalities and counties in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.

<LI>The organizations that represent municipalities in Manitoba (AMM), Saskatchewan (SUMA and
     SARM) and Alberta (AAMDC and AUMA).

<LI> The Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia.
</UL>


<H3>WHAT PROJECTS ARE ELIGIBLE?</H3>

Provincial secondary highways and municipal grain roads that are deteriorating or have become unsafe
as a result of increased heavy grain truck traffic. The PGRP will consider funding for a road directly
impacted by either of the following:<BR>
<UL>
<LI><strong>Grain Delivery Points </strong>which have experienced or will experience a significant
increase in the total volume of grain-related products handled. In addition, the delivery points must exist
or be under construction and have a high probability of being viable over a minimum of 10 years.<BR>

          OR   <BR>
<LI><strong>Grain-Related Value-Added Industries</strong> which have experienced, or will
experience, a significant increase in the volume of grain hauled into the facilities. These industries must
exist or be under construction and have a high probability of being viable over a minimum of 10 years.
Grain-related value-added agriculture industries include, but are not limited to, concentrated animal
feeding operations (e.g. hog barns) and agricultural processing plants (e.g. ethanol plants).
     </UL>

<H3>FUNDING ALLOCATIONS</h3>

Over a five-year period, from 2001-02 to 2005-06, Canada will provide a maximum of $175 million
for eligible municipal road and provincial secondary highway construction projects. The funding
allocations to each western province are based on the respective provincial share of the
grain-dependent branch lines as listed in the Canada Transportation Act.



<H3>COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS</h3>
     
Cost-sharing arrangements have been negotiated with the provinces and vary with the type of roadway
and province.
     <DL>
<DT><strong> Saskatchewan</strong>
<DD>With a federal contribution of $106.8 million cost-shared with provincial and municipal
governments, more than $217 million in program spending will be delivered for the construction and
upgrading of secondary highways and municipal roads. 
   
<DT><strong>Manitoba</strong>
<DD>
Approximately $34 million in federal funds will be supplemented by provincial and municipal
governments to deliver more than $66 million in program spending toward the construction and
upgrading of secondary highways and municipal roads.
     
-<DT><strong>Alberta</strong>
<DD>Federal contributions will total more than $32 million, triggering about $47 million in construction
funds for the province's municipal road system.
       
<DT><strong>British Columbia</strong>
<DD>Program funds totalling $2.2 million will be provided for municipal road improvements in the
Peace River region of British Columbia.
 <DT><strong> In Total ...</strong>
<DD>
Through federal, provincial and municipal government contributions, the PGRP will generate
approximately $334 million in road construction in Western Canada.
