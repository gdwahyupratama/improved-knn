    TORONTO, Nov. 30 /CNW/ - The Ministry of Transportation is moving quickly
to address the Provincial Auditor's concerns about medically unfit drivers,
Transportation Minister Brad Clark announced today.
    "Ontario has the safest roads in Canada, and the second safest in North
America." Clark said. "And, maintaining that excellent safety record is one of
this government's top priorities."
    Clark was referring to road safety statistics that show Ontario's
fatality rate in 1999 dropped to 1.10 per 10,000 licensed drivers, marking the
11th consecutive year of improvement in this category, a key measure of
overall road user safety. Only Massachusetts, at 0.94, had a lower rate among
North American jurisdictions.
    In his 2000-01 Annual Report, the Provincial Auditor raised concerns
about the backlog of 30,000 reports from medical practitioners, some dating as
far back as 1997. The Ministry of Transportation today reported that 22,000 of
these cases have been reviewed and processed. The rest of the backlog will be
eliminated by Spring 2002.
    As well, the Ministry has strengthened intervention programs on all
fronts. Actions taken to date include,

    -  Developing an improved reporting form that will allow doctors to more
       readily report medical fitness cases;

    -  Ensuring that high priority medical cases are processed within three
       to eight weeks;

    -  Increasing staff, improving training and implementing a telephone
       protocol to improve reporting methods.

    "I believe that the Provincial Auditor serves a valuable role for the
province of Ontario and for the taxpayers," Clark said. "As of this moment,
more than 70 per cent of all the recommendations the Auditor made to my
ministry have been completed, and we will move very quickly on the rest."
