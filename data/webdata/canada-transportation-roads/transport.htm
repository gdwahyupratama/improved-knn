              <P>Canada&iacute;s history is closely linked to the history of
              transportation. One need only look at a map to understand the
              various geographical obstacles posed by the nation&iacute;s landscape.
              Transportation has always played &oacute; and will continue to
              play &oacute; a vital role in Canada&iacute;s relationship with
              the land.</P>

              <P>Although it is the world&iacute;s second largest country,
              Canada ranks 28th in terms of population. With a population density
              of approximately three persons per square kilometre, Canada&iacute;s
              30 million people are scattered across an area that is more than
              10 million square kilometres in size, stretching 5,500 kilometres
              from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific.</P>

              <P>What Canada needs is safe, efficient, sustainable transportation
              by the most appropriate combination of modes &oacute; air, surface
              and marine. Canada&iacute;s transportation system is well-positioned
              to make the best use of each mode and to ensure that the balance
              among the modes is both economically and environmentally sustainable.</P>

              <P><B>Safety and Security</B><BR>
              As a nation, Canada has an excellent aviation safety record.
              Despite the unprecedented growth in passenger travel in recent
              years, the number of aviation accidents actually declined by
              nearly 38 per cent between 1990 and 1997.</P>

              <P>In 1996, marine accidents were at an 18-year low. Canada recently
              signed a joint declaration with many other maritime nations on
              port state control that will tighten the enforcement of international
              ship standards and reduce the number of unsafe ships plying Canadian
              waters.</P>

              <P>Although highway traffic has doubled, Canada has seen a 50
              per cent decline in traffic fatalities over the past 25 years.
              In fact, the figures for 1997 are the lowest since these statistics
              began.</P>

              <P>Railway accident rates and crossing fatalities have reached
              their lowest levels in a decade.</P>

              <P><B>Air Transportation</B><BR>
              Canada&iacute;s aviation industry has expanded dramatically over
              the years. The number of registered aircraft increased by 147
              per cent between 1970 and 1995 and climbed to 28,054 in&Yacute;1997.
              The number of enplaned and deplaned passengers carried per year
              by commercial airlines reached an all-time high of over 78 million
              in 1997.</P>

              <P>Canada&iacute;s domestic routes are served by its two major
              carriers, Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International, and
              their regional affiliates, as well as by smaller independent
              operators that use both jet and propeller-driven equipment. In
              1997, some 1,502 licensed domestic carriers provided scheduled
              and charter services throughout the country. Scheduled international
              services to and from 60 countries are provided on the basis of
              bilateral agreements between Canada and each country. The 1995
              &igrave;Open Skies&icirc; agreement with the United States, for
              example, has provided Canadians with significantly improved access
              to major U.S. business destinations.</P>

              <P>New international all-cargo air services policies have recently
              been announced for both scheduled and chartered flights to provide
              shippers and air carriers with additional opportunities and more
              flexibility for moving cargo by air.</P>

              <P>The cornerstone of the modernization of Canada&iacute;s air
              transportation system is the federal government&iacute;s National
              Airports Policy. The policy allows for the transfer of airports
              to local groups that know their market and are free to run their
              airport like a business. Since the policy was announced in July
              1994, nearly 90 airports have been transferred. In fact, 90 per
              cent of all commercial air travellers in Canada now use facilities
              that have been transferred.</P>

              <P>Since 1996, Canada&iacute;s air navigation system has been
              operated by Nav Canada, an independent not-for-profit corporation.
              Safety will continue to be regulated and monitored by Transport
              Canada.</P>

              <P><B>Marine Transport</B><BR>
              Canada has 59,509 kilometres of coastline plus 3,000 kilometres
              of inland waterways (excluding island coastlines).</P>

              <P>The marine sector handles more than 200 million tonnes of
              cargo each year, generating over $2.5 billion in revenue annually
              and directly employing more than 45,000 Canadians. The Canada
              Marine Act, which received Royal Assent on June 11, 1998, will
              commercialize Canada&iacute;s public ports, enabling them to
              be transferred to local not-for-profit organizations.</P>

              <P>The Act also allowed for the commercialization of the St.
              Lawrence Seaway on October 8, 1998. The Seaway is one of the
              world&iacute;s largest inland waterways (3,700 kilometres), stretching
              from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the western end of Lake Superior.</P>

              <P><B>Road Transportation</B><BR>
              Canada has more automobiles per person than any other country
              in the world except the United States, with at least one automobile
              for every two Canadians. Today there are more than 900,000 kilometres
              of roads and highways; the national highway system is over 24,000
              kilometres in length. Canada also boasts the longest highway
              in the world &oacute; the Trans-Canada Highway &oacute; and the
              busiest section of highway in the world &oacute; Highway 401
              through the Greater Toronto Area.</P>

              <P>Intercity buses provide the most extensive public passenger
              services in Canada. Nearly 1,000 operators offer school bus,
              charter and urban transit services in more than 3,400 communities.</P>

              <P>Roads also support one of the most highly used forms of cargo
              transportation; in 1997, about 86 per cent of total freight surface
              revenues in Canada were generated by the trucking industry. An
              estimated 118,000 large trucks that haul freight commercially;
              trucking revenues and services (including for-hire, private and
              courier) were valued at approximately $31&Yacute;billion in 1996.</P>

              <P>Technology is playing an increasingly important role in Canada&iacute;s
              highway system. For example, there is a pilot project in place
              to test the feasibility of allowing specially equipped trucks
              to cross the U.S. border without stopping; the time savings could
              make a significant difference to shippers, especially those hauling
              perishable goods.</P>

              <P><B>Rail Transport</B><BR>
              Railways continue to play an important part in Canada&iacute;s
              transportation network. Canadian National Railway (CN) and Canadian
              Pacific Railway (CP) are responsible for operating most of Canada&iacute;s
              rail freight services. VIA Rail Canada, a federal Crown corporation,
              provides passenger rail service.</P>

              <P>Approximately 46 Canadian railways operate on some 50,000
              route kilometres of track. In 1996, some 4 million rail passengers
              travelled a total of 1.46 billion passenger-kilometres. Railways
              account for 280 billion tonne-kilometres of freight.</P>

              <P><B>Technology</B><BR>
              Canadians continue to introduce improvements across the spectrum
              of transportation technology. Developments also include a new
              commuter turbo-prop and turbo-fan aircraft, as well as a unique
              aircraft that can scoop up 6.6 tonnes of water from a lake in
              10 seconds and drop it on a forest fire with pinpoint accuracy.
              Research is also being conducted into safer log trucks and airplane
              de-icing regulations.</P>

              <P>With the launch of the Alouette 1 in 1962, Canada became the
              third nation in space and has since earned an international reputation
              in aerospace technology with such developments as the Canadarm,
              which was designed for the U.S. space shuttle program and is
              in ongoing use.</P>

              <P>Canada is also a world leader in the development of alternative
              fuel sources. The Ballard fuel cell, for example, will power
              the cars of the future with no byproducts other than hot water;
              the auto industry has now invested hundreds of millions of dollars
              into this new venture. Equally innovative is the new &igrave;clean
              air truck,&icirc; which runs on natural gas with diesel pilot
              ignition; this truck emits 85 per cent fewer smog-producing byproducts
              than do regular trucks.</P>

              <P><B>Sustainability</B><BR>
              About 27 per cent of Canada&iacute;s greenhouse gas emissions
              come from transportation sources &oacute; mostly road transportation.
              In 1997, Canada made a substantial commitment in Kyoto, Japan
              to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to six per cent below 1990
              levels over the period 2008 to 2012. This presents a particular
              challenge for the transportation sector. To meet this challenge,
              federal and provincial environment ministers met and approved
              a process for developing a national strategy on climate change.
              The process called for the establishment of a number of &igrave;issue
              tables,&icirc; including one that will deal with transportation.
              Sustainability must be at the heart of any credible strategy
              for Canadian transportation if a prosperous national future is
              to be secured.
