        <font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">TAC’s origins date back to 1914, when the Canadian
      Good Roads Association was founded. CGRA was mainly concerned with the establishment of a superior national road
      network and was one of the main forces behind construction of the
      Trans-Canada Highway. During
      the 1950s, CGRA became more involved with specialized technical activities
      and by the 1960s, its role had broadened, resulting in a name change to
      the Roads and Transportation Association of Canada (RTAC) in 1970.<br><br>
      Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, RTAC continued to
      expand its mandate to include all modes of transport for passengers and
      freight, and, in 1990, the name of the organization was changed to reflect
      the increased scope of activities.<br><br>The
      Transportation Association of Canada now has a multi-modal,
      multi-disciplinary emphasis, in addition to its traditional roadway
      transport interests. Members
      include federal, provincial and municipal transportation departments;
      other government departments; shippers and freight carriers; passenger
      carriers; contractors and road-builders; consultants and academic and
      research interests. This broad membership base and TAC’s cooperative
      approach make the association distinct from other transportation
      organizations.<br><br>
