<i><u>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">CANADA TRANSPORTATION ACT</u></i><u> REVIEW</p>
</u></b>
<p>When the <i>Canada Transportation Act</i> (CTA) came into effect in 1996, it
required that a comprehensive review be undertaken within four years. The
Minister appointed a five-member review panel on June&nbsp;29,&nbsp;2000, to
conduct the review. The panel was to report within one year on the economic
regulation of transportation activities under the legislative authority of
Parliament. The Minister received the CTA Review Panel's final report on
June&nbsp;28,&nbsp;2001, and it was tabled in Parliament on
July&nbsp;18,&nbsp;2001.</p>
<p>Mr. Brian Flemming, a former educator, policy advisor and director of a
number of public companies, chaired the panel. Mr. Jean Patenaude, who has over
20 years of experience in transportation and law, served as vice-chair. Other
members included Mr. Glen Findlay, a farmer and former Minister of Highways and
Transportation in Manitoba; The Honourable Bob Rae, former Premier of Ontario
and former leader of the New Democratic Party of Ontario; and Dr. William G.
Waters II, professor and director of the Centre for Transportation Studies at
the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p>The Minister asked that the review panel consider:</p>
<ul>
  
    <li>the effectiveness of the legislative and regulatory environment to
    sustain capital expenditures required to enhance productivity and promote
    innovation;</li>
    <li>support for Canadian transportation stakeholders in meeting global
    logistics requirements and adapting to the new e-business environment;</li>
    <li>public policy issues that may emerge from newly arising industry
    structures;</li>
    <li>government powers to support sustainable development objectives; and</li>
    <li>the advisability of measures to preserve urban rail corridors for future
    mass-transit use.</li>
  </ul>
<p>The panel was also asked to submit a six-month interim report on ways to
increase competition in the railway sector, including enhanced running rights,
proposals for regional railways and other access concepts. These concepts needed
to be assessed in the broader context of increasing North American integration
and ensuring cost-effective service for shippers over the long term. The interim
report highlighted stakeholder positions and presented a review of various
proposals. The panel determined that more detailed work was necessary as their
review continued to properly assess the full economic, regulatory and legal
impacts of competitive rail access.</p>
<p>The panel's final report contains more than 90 recommendations which will be
considered by Transport&nbsp;Canada in the transportation blueprint policy
review process which the Minister launched earlier this year. The transportation
blueprint project is intended to renew the transportation agenda of the
Government of Canada by developing a strategy that will guide future decisions
in transportation over the next decade and beyond. The project will build upon
the work of the CTA Review Panel, the Transportation Climate Change Table, the
June 2000 Transportation Millennium Conference and current consultations with
stakeholders.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><u>REPORT OF THE PANEL REVIEWING THE <i>CANADA TRANSPORTATION
ACT</p>
</i></u></b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<b><u>
<p><a name="Principles">Principles</a></p>
</u></b>
<p>The panel relied on principles such as competition, flexibility,
harmonization and transparency to guide them in developing their report. To
embed these principles in the Act, the panel has recommended that the policy
statement of the Act be redrafted to reflect an efficient transportation system
that makes the best use of all modes at the lowest total cost, guided by
competition and market forces and where regulation is needed, it should be
neutral between carriers and modes.</p>
<b><u>
<p><a name="Competition in the freight rail and airline industries">Competition in the freight rail and airline industries</a></p>
</u></b>
<p>The panel's review focused on the concerns of shippers using rail freight
services and the extent of market power exercised by the mainline railways,
concerns arising from Air Canada's acquisition of Canadian Airlines
International and increased concentration in the domestic airline industry, and
how to review possible future mergers in the transportation sector.</p>
<p>For the freight rail industry, the panel makes a number of recommendations
including that interswitching provisions be retained, that competitive
connection rates replace competitive line rates and that running rights
provisions be enhanced.</p>
<p>With respect to the airline industry, the panel recommends that the
Government of Canada pursue the benefits of foreign competition through
multilateral negotiations to liberalize air services, raise the foreign
ownership ceiling, eliminate potential barriers to market entry for domestic
airlines, remove the Canadian Transportation Agency's responsibilities for
monitoring air fares, and require Air Canada to give at least 180 days notice of
services it plans to terminate in the first six months of 2003.</p>
<b><u>
<p><a name="Transport mergers">Transport mergers</a></p>
</u></b>
<p>The panel recommends that, in parallel with the <i>Competition Act</i> review
process that looks into competition issues, a process be established to review
potential mergers in all transportation modes under federal jurisdiction and
report to the Minister of Transport on public interest considerations.</p>
<b><u>
<p><a name="Commercial operations in ferries, passenger trains and urban transit">Commercial operations in ferries, passenger trains and urban transit</a></p>
</u></b>
<p>The panel recommends a stronger relationship between the cost of providing
services and the prices charged for them as well as less reliance on public
subsidies.</p>
<p>For ferries, the panel recommends that the Government of Canada continue its
efforts to promote innovation through commercialization and divestiture to other
levels of government. The panel recommends for intercity passenger services that
the Government of Canada continue to support rail services to remote communities
but commercialize tourism services and services in the Quebec City-Windsor
corridor. For urban transit, the panel identified cost-effective ways for local
governments and agencies to improve transit's attractiveness and recommends
experimentation with alternative delivery models and innovative forms of
service.</p>
<b><u>
<p><a name="Efficiency in other modes">Efficiency in other modes</a></p>
</u></b>
<p>The panel's recommendations promote the principles of commercially driven
competition and harmonization for a seamless transportation system.</p>
<p>For marine, the panel recommends full cost recovery and early negotiations
with the</p>
<p>United States to promote greater competition in the domestic shipping
industry. On the trucking side, the panel recommends that federal, provincial
and territorial governments establish a time frame for developing and
implementing an effective framework to govern all elements of the trucking
sector. The panel also recommends for the intercity bus industry that work
continue toward reducing regulatory fragmentation.</p>
<b><u>
<p><a name="Discipline in the provision of infrastructure services">Discipline in the provision of infrastructure services</a></p>
</u></b>
<p>The panel commends the Government of Canada's policy of placing the provision
of transportation infrastructure on a more commercial footing over the past
decade or more.</p>
<p>For airports, air navigation, ports and the St. Lawrence Seaway, the panel
believes that it may now be the time to consider a long-term strategy to
transform the major ports and airports into for-profit corporations. In the
meantime, the panel recommends several measures to strengthen the accountability
and control of airport and port authorities.</p>
<p>For roads, the panel recommends that the Government of Canada encourage
provinces and territories to establish roads management and funding agencies to
set charges and fees for road use. This would give road users a say in decisions
about how much to charge for road use. The panel also recommends that other
modes providing alternatives to road expansion should be allowed to compete for
road funds.</p>
<b><u>
<p><a name="Urban rail corridors">Urban rail corridors</a></p>
</u></b>
<p>The panel recommends enhancing access for commuter rail services and amending
the existing process to preserve urban rail corridors for urban transit.</p>
<b><u>
<p><a name="Access for persons with disabilities">Access for persons with disabilities</a></p>
</u></b>
<p>The panel recommends that the Canadian Transportation Agency's power to
investigate accessibility matters on its own motion be reinstated, and that the
longstanding attendant airfare issue be resolved as quickly as possible.</p>
<b><u>
<p><a name="Sustainable development">Sustainable development</a></p>
</u></b>
<p>The panel believes its proposed approach to roads management offers an
opportunity to achieve needed cooperation. Progress is likely to result from
charging directly for road use and permitting urban transport and other
potentially more sustainable modes to compete for funding with road projects.</p>
<b><u>
<p><a name="E-business">E-business</a></p>
</u></b>
<p>The panel recommends service initiatives to facilitate and to encourage the
development of</p>
<p>e-business and e-commerce skills and training and that the Government of
Canada continue to develop e-government initiatives.</p>
<b><u>
<p><a name="Other matters">Other matters</a></p>
</u></b>
<p>In addition, the panel suggests that all transportation policy be guided by
overlying principles, proposes to increase the availability of transportation
data and recommends that the Government of Canada increase its support for
transportation research.</p>
