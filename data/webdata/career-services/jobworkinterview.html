<p><font size=+1><b>PURPOSE</B></FONT><font size=+0>&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>The interview is a mutual exchange of information between
an employer and a candidate for a position. The primary objectives are:</FONT></P>

<ul>
<li><font size=+0>To supply information about yourself that is not contained
in your resume; to show that you understand yourself and have a sense of
direction in your career.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<ul>
<li><font size=+0>To enable the employer to evaluate your personality and
attitudes in terms of the demands of the organization and the possible
position.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<ul>
<li><font size=+0>To enable you to gain information about the organization
and the job which is not available through other sources.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<ul>
<li><font size=+0>To give you and the employer an opportunity to discuss
the desirability of further contact or an offer of employment.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<p><b><font size=+1>INTERVIEW PREPARATION</FONT></B><font size=+0>&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<p><b><font size=+0>KNOWLEDGE OF YOURSELF</FONT></B></P>

<p><font size=+0>To impress an employer you must be well prepared and understand
the value of what you have to offer. Be able to relate your assets to the
position and the organization. To accomplish this you must know yourself.
Review your self assessment sheets and your <i><a href="resumes.html#preparing" webstripperlinkwas="resumes.html#preparing">Preparing
for the Resume and Job Interview</A></I> worksheet. Review your resume
and be prepared to answer questions about the contents. Substantiate all
points with information. Rather than trying to determine only at what level
you are currently functioning, some interviewers want to see how you have
grown over time in areas related to their position(s), e.g., interpersonal/work
skills, motivation. Some will compel you to talk about your failures and
mistakes to find out what you have learned or have since done differently.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<p><b><font size=+0>KNOWLEDGE OF COMPANY/ORGANIZATION</FONT></B></P>

<p><font size=+0>You <b>must</B> be familiar with the <b>position</B> and
the <b>organization</B> so that you can demonstrate how and why you will
be an effective employee. Try to find out as much as you can about the
organization prior to your interview. Ask the company to send you material,
e.g., annual report, brochures, in-house newsletter or magazine. This knowledge
will also help you to decide whether you want to be associated with a particular
organization. Review information in the section on Researching Employers.
Obtain information, if you can, on whom you will be meeting with and the
schedule for the interview period. If you can find out about your interviewer(s),
e.g., name, title, background, in advance, you will be able to commit their
names to memory and use them during the interviews.</FONT></P>

<p><b>YOUR PHYSICAL APPEARANCE</B></P>

<p><font size=+0>Your success or failure in the interview can depend on
your appearance and the interviewer's first impression of you. If it is
not good, it will be much harder during the rest of the interview to change
the interviewer's mind. Look neat, clean and well-groomed. Select proper
clothing for the type of organization interviewing you. If in doubt, be
conservative.</FONT></P>

<p>&nbsp;<b><font size=+1>DURING THE INTERVIEW</FONT></B></P>

<p><font size=+0>Don't worry about being nervous during the interview—this
is normal and will be expected. Just remember, the interviewer wants to
hire you if you have the right qualifications and interest in the position.
Many interviewers will begin the interview with some &quot;small talk&quot;
to help you relax. This may seem irrelevant to the position, but you are
still being evaluated. Take these opening moments to show a great attitude,
e.g., pleasure speaking with the interviewer, interesting facts about the
organization which you found during your research. You may want to ask
some questions about the organization, its products/services to hear the
interviewer talk, to get a sense of energy level and pacing.</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>The second phase of the interview consists of the interviewer
asking you questions to try to determine your match to the specifications
needed to do the work well. The most reliable way for an interviewer to
project how you would perform in the future is to examine the past. Therefore,
many employers prepare some behaviour-based questions. Which ones are asked
depends on the work you are interviewing for. Examples:</FONT></P>

<ul>
<li><font size=+0>Tell me about a time when you had to go beyond what is
ordinarily expected of an employee in order to get a job done.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<ul>
<li><font size=+0>Give me an example of an important goal you set and describe
your success in reaching it.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<ul>
<li><font size=+0>Discuss occasions when you adapted to a wide variety
of people and situations.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<ul>
<li><font size=+0>Describe a time when you had an angry customer on the
telephone. </FONT></LI>
</UL>

<p><font size=+0>By analyzing the questions asked of you, you will be able
to find out more particulars about the job for which you have applied.
What emphasis does the interviewer seem to be placing on which skills,
knowledge, personality traits and attitudes. That insight can help you
focus your answers more easily to the employer’s position.</FONT></P>

&quot;What experience do you have organizing projects?&quot;, you would
determine that the qualification being evaluated is organizational skills.
Your Skill/Knowledge/Trait Statement could be, &quot;I have developed excellent
organizational skills by working on two major projects. The one I would
like to tell you about came to a successful conclusion six months ago.&quot;
(Whatever statement you make must be true! Don’t lie or embellish.) The
illustration you would choose to confirm your statement would be a project
that required similar competency to the typical project that the prospective
employer would want you to organize. Describe the what, who, when, where,
why, how, and talk about the successful outcome or what you learned from
the experience. As you tell the story, the employer can see or live through
the action with you. The next step is the one that most candidates for
a position do not do. Tell the interviewer what benefits or competitive
advantage you can bring because of that experience. &quot;As part of the

</UL>

<p><font size=+0>To supplement information obtained prior to the interview,
you need to ask additional questions during the interview. The questions,
however, should be pertinent to the position and show your enthusiasm and
knowledge. By asking intelligent, well-thought-out questions, you show
the employer you are serious about the organization and need more information.
It also indicates to the recruiter that you have done your homework. Examples
are:</FONT></P>

<ul>
<li><font size=+0>Do you have a copy of the detailed job description?</FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>What do you see as the priorities for someone in this
position?</FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>What would be a typical first-year assignment?</FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>What training programs do you have available for your
employees?</FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>What level of responsibility could I expect in this position?</FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>What qualities do you look for in new employees?</FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>Is there a typical career path for a person in this position?</FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>How are employees evaluated and promoted?</FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>What is a realistic timeframe for promotion?</FONT></LI>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;</FONT><b>VERBAL/NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION</B></P>

<ul>
<li><font size=+0>Acknowledge introductions with a smile and a firm handshake.
Maintain good eye contact and smile when appropriate. Be enthusiastic and
responsive. Radiate energy. How are you going to demonstrate your enthusiasm
if you tend to be a quiet person? As you talk about your past and present
activities in answer to questions, your passion and energy can be communicated
both through the words of your stories and your body language (e.g., sparkling
eyes and tone of voice).</FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>Sit comfortably, without slouching. Don't put anything
on your lap or in your hands as it will restrict your natural body movement
and you may be tempted to &quot;play&quot; with it. Keep your clipboard,
note pad, briefcase, or portfolio on the floor beside your chair for easy
retrieval when necessary. </FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>Respond to questions specifically and concisely but give
sufficient details to enable the interviewer to evaluate your credentials.
Interviewers become frustrated when they have to listen to long rambling
answers. Think before you speak. It is quite acceptable to pause before
talking in order to organize your thoughts, but <b>think quietly</B>. Avoid
verbal fillers such as um, ah, you know, etc., or repeating the question
in order to provide thinking time. Use business language. Avoid slang.
Speak clearly.</FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>Prepare in advance to talk about any topic that you are
concerned or feel uncomfortable about. If there is something that you don’t
want an interviewer to inquire about, you can be sure that somehow the
interviewer will sense it, and ask. Practise your answer out loud often
enough to feel confident when saying it. Maintain poise and self control.
Maybe you need to think about that difficult issue as a learning opportunity
which has made you a better person. </FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>Answer questions truthfully. If you are playing a game
in order to get hired, you will be found out once you are on the job.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<p><b><font size=+1>TYPES OF INTERVIEWS</FONT></B><font size=+0>&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<p><b><font size=+0>ONE-ON-ONE</FONT></B></P>

<p>The most common interview format is one interviewer speaking with one
candidate.</P>

<p><b>TEAM/BOARD INTERVIEW WITH TWO OR MORE PERSONS</B></P>

<p>The key is good eye-to-eye contact with the person who asks you the
question, but remember to look at the other persons present periodically
in order to include them in your answer.</P>

<p><b>STRUCTURED INTERVIEW</B></P>

<p>All candidates are asked the same questions for the employer's ease
in evaluating applicants. If there is important information that you have
not conveyed by the end of the interview, when asked if you have any questions
or anything to add, present your additional qualifications. Usually the
interviewer will make written notes of your answers. </P>

<p><b>UNSTRUCTURED INTERVIEW</B></P>

<p>You have a better opportunity to convey information as there is no set
agenda for questions by the interviewer. However, you need to be well prepared
and know the points you want to make.</P>

<p><b>TELEPHONE INTERVIEW</B></P>

<p>Because of the high cost of paying travel expenses for candidates to
the employer's location, some first interviews are being conducted over
the phone. If the call surprises you and you are not ready for an interview,
ask the person to call back in 15 minutes, or arrange another time which
will be mutually convenient. You need time to refresh your memory on the
organization and what points about yourself you want to make. All points
about good interview skills still apply. You just do not have to dress
for the occasion. However, you may find that dressing up may help you perform
better. Keep your resume and your list of questions to ask in front of
you. Have a pen and paper available to note any comments or questions you
may have during the interview.</P>

<p><b>COMPUTER INTERVIEWS</B></P>

<p>Because of the number of qualified applicants available for positions,
you may find that your first interview will be with a computer. The purpose
of this screening is to compare your answers to the information on your
resume. Be just as diligent with your answers as you would with a human
interviewer. You don’t want the computer to find reasons to screen you
out.</P>

<p><b>VIDEO CONFERENCING</B></P>

<p>Computer technology through on-line interview rooms allows companies
to prescreen more candidates from farther afield than has been possible
through visits to colleges and universities in the past. The pool of applicants
then invited to the company for personal interviews can be more comprehensive.
Recruiters conduct live, face-to-face interviews with job applicants via
personal computers equipped with cameras and speakers. Use the same strategies
you would if you were meeting in person, knee-to-knee. Clothing, body language,
and dialogue do not differ. Your agenda is to be offered an invitation
to meet personally for a second interview at the company.</P>

<p><b>SECOND INTERVIEW - PLANT/OFFICE VISIT</B></P>

<p>Except for short-term positions, e.g., co-op, a candidate being seriously
considered by a prospective employer will be invited to visit the organization
at one of its locations. One purpose is to provide you with an opportunity
to meet other staff. The second is to give more people an opportunity to
interview you at greater depth to determine whether a good match is developing.
The visit can take an entire day, sometimes more. When an organization
offers to pay your expenses to travel to the interview, be prudent in submitting
costs. Your choice of moderate rather than luxurious accommodation, food,
transportation, etc. will reflect your good judgement. </P>

<p><b><font size=+1>ENDING THE INTERVIEW</FONT></B></P>

<p><font size=+0>When it appears that the interviewer is about to end the
interview, there are certain points you should make sure you have covered
before you leave the room:&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<ul>
<li><font size=+0>Be aware of the interview process yet to come before
a candidate is selected for the job (e.g., another interview in same/other
location, meetings with other individuals in organization, etc.)</FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>Ask the interviewer when you can expect to hear about
a decision or ask when you should make an inquiry as a follow-up.</FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>Express your interest in the position and thank the interviewer
for interviewing you.</FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>Ask for a business card or ensure that you have the interviewer's
name, title, address so that you can send a thank-you letter (except for
job interviews through co-op scheduling). Make sure your letter arrives
within 24 hours of the interview.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<p><font size=+0>&nbsp;</FONT><b><font size=+1>EMPLOYER EVALUATION</FONT></B></P>

<p><font size=+0>Employers usually have a formal rating sheet with predetermined
areas such as:</FONT></P>

<ul>
<li><font size=+0>neat and clean overall appearance/poise/communicative
skills</FONT></LI>

<li><font size=+0>academic/work achievements (learning ability, standards

<p><b><font size=+1>EVALUATING YOUR PERFORMANCE</FONT><font size=+0>&nbsp;</FONT></B></P>

<p><b><font size=+0>Evaluate how well you did after each interview</FONT>.

<li>Did I present my qualifications in the best manner possible, giving

<p><b><font size=+1>TIPS</FONT></B></P>

<p><font size=+0>Get a good night’s sleep before your interview. Believe
in yourself!</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>Be punctual. Arrive at least 15 minutes early to allow
yourself time to collect your thoughts. Take the opportunity to observe
the working environment. Keep your eyes and ears open. Be friendly with
everyone.</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>Try to get the interviewer to describe the position and
duties to you early in the interview so that you can relate your background
and skills to the particular position. Your responsibility is to convince
the employer that you are the best person for the job. Since the interviewer
may not draw it out of you, remember the points which are important about
your qualifications. Give <b>descriptive examples or proof</B> whenever
you can throughout the interview. Try to paint a visual picture that the
employer will remember. The true stories you tell about yourself will differentiate
you from the other 10 to 20 applicants. Radiate genuine enthusiasm.</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>Watch the interviewer for clues on how the interview is
progressing. Is the interviewer's face or body language telling you that
your answers are too long, not detailed enough, too boring, etc.? If in
doubt, ask the interviewer if more details are needed. Listen carefully
to the question and the way it is phrased. If it can be interpreted in
more than one way, and if you are unsure what the interviewer really wants
you to discuss, ask for clarification.</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>If the interviewer becomes silent, look for the reason.
Has the person momentarily run out of questions? Is the person testing
you to see how comfortable you are with silence? Is the interviewer finding
your answers too brief and waiting for you to elaborate more in order to
get a better sense of who you are?</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>If the interviewer outlines a hypothetical situation and
asks you what you would do if you found yourself in those circumstances,
imagine yourself in that situation. Give the best answer you can if it
is a situation which you have not already experienced and successfully
dealt with. In many instances, the interviewer is more interested in finding
out how you would react under those circumstances, and in your thinking/analytical
process than in your final answer. In your analysis, think about which
are the most important facts. Watch for a &quot;red herring&quot;. Do you
need to get additional information from someone else in the scenario before
you could make a decision? Do you want the interviewer to supply more detail
for clarification on a key point?</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>When the interviewer asks about your weaknesses, choose
something work-related, but not so serious as to disqualify you. <b>Briefly
</B>mention one, always ending on a <b>positive </B>note. Show what you
have learned from the experience or what you are doing to change. If pressed
for more than one weakness, have another one or two ready to discuss. Also,
if asked about any negative employment experience (e.g., being fired, trouble
with supervisor), don't criticize past employers. Briefly acknowledge any
difficulty and say what you have learned or discuss the positive outcome
of the situation. By looking so carefully at weaknesses or negatives, an
employer is trying to determine where you might have problems on the job.
The bottom line for some positions may be: &quot;Let’s hire the candidate
who will do the work adequately while having the fewest serious shortcomings&quot;.</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>Except for co-op scheduled interviews, don't inquire about
salary, bonuses, benefits in the initial interview. If you are pressed
to give a salary expectation, turn it around to the interviewer and ask
what the organization would ordinarily pay a person with your credentials.
If you are still pressed, know what salary range would apply to that type
of job in that geographic location. You could try to obtain this information
by speaking to people in the field prior to your interview. Good salary
information is also available on the Internet.</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>Practise in a mock interview with another person. Check
for quality of information in your answers, and the positive, non-verbal
reinforcement of your words. By speaking out loud you can &quot;hear&quot;
your answers to ensure you cover the topic well. Don't practise so much
though that you lose your spontaneity and your answers sound rehearsed.</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>If you do not receive a job offer (especially if you felt
the &quot;fit&quot; was very good), you may want to contact the interviewer
to get feedback on your performance. It could be (1) they hired someone
with better qualifications. Or (2) you didn’t adequately present your qualifications,
thereby causing an incorrect assessment of your capability. If the reason
is (1), keep going—you’ll find the right match! If (2), make changes in
your next interview!</FONT></P>

<ul>
<li>birthplace, ancestry, ethnic origin, place of origin</LI>

<li>sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status</LI>

<li>age</LI>

<li>race, colour</LI>

<li>religion, creed</LI>

<li>citizenship</LI>

<li>education</LI>

<li>record of offences</LI>

<li>handicap</LI>

<li>references and membership in organizations<b>&nbsp;</B></LI>
</UL>

<p>Although it is ultimately the responsibility of the interviewer to know
the law, this may not always be the case. It is to your advantage to be
informed on the subject. For information, contact the OHRC.</P>

<p>You've done the reading and know your rights as they pertain to the
interview. Now you're in the middle of one and have just been asked what
is clearly an illegal question. What should you do? There is no clear-cut
answer. Much depends on you.<b>&nbsp;</B></P>

<p><b>HERE ARE SOME IDEAS:</B></P>

<ul>
<li>In some cases, you may be able to answer the &quot;hidden&quot; question.
Try to think of what information the employer is trying to elicit. Example:
&quot;Do you have or plan to have children?&quot; may be a disguise for
&quot;Are you going to be able to work overtime?&quot; or &quot;Will you
be requesting time off for school holidays/events?&quot; In this example,
your answer should convey your willingness to work overtime as required
or make alternate child care arrangements.</LI>
</UL>

<ul>
<li>You may elect to say &quot;Why do you ask?&quot; or &quot;Would you
explain how this point is connected to the qualifications for this job?&quot;
This may cause the employer to reconsider and/or clarify the question.
This may offend some employers, but probably not the majority.<b>&nbsp;</B></LI>
</UL>

<ul>
<li>If you feel that you should not answer the question (you shouldn't
have to after all) or that you are not interested in working for the company,
you may state, &quot;I don't feel obligated to answer that&quot; or &quot;That
question is inappropriate&quot;. If you choose this option, you will either
enlighten (the employer may not realize it is illegal and will be happy
that you pointed it out) or offend (the employer may not consider you for
the position).<b>&nbsp;</B></LI>
</UL>

<ul>
<li>HOWEVER you handle the situation, you do have the right to call the
OHRC if you feel that you might have been discriminated against during
an interview. Tell them what happened and they will advise you on how to
proceed.</LI>
</UL>

<p><b><font size=+1>Ombudsperson, University of Waterloo</FONT></B></P>

<p><font size=+0>If you feel you have been discriminated against in any
way during a job interview either within or outside of the University,
you may approach the Ombudsperson regarding the matter. You will be referred
to a lawyer outside of the University if the matter cannot be handled by
the University itself.</FONT></P>
