<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0><b>Effective letter writing
is an essential aspect of your job search.</B> Good writing takes time
and is hard work. Compose documents that reflect your own personality.
Do not copy someone else's. Send handwritten correspondence only when requested
by the employer. </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>This section of Step 4 will
discuss how to write cover and broadcast letters, thank-you letters, letters
in response to being rejected for a job, withdrawing from consideration
and declining a job offer letters, and accepting a job offer letter.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>STRATEGIES</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>You will probably be in contact
with several hundred people during your career planning and job search
activities. These people form two groups:<br>
<b>1)Pre-contact </B>- you have not spoken with or written to them.<br>
<b>2)Post-contact </B>- the individuals know you from your previous contact
with them.</FONT></FONT></P>

<center><table border=5 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=2 width="85%">
<tr>
<td><b>Pre-contact: </B>Obtain the name and title of the person to whom
you should write and ensure that you have the correct spelling. Telephone
the organization so that your information is current. Use Ms. to address
a woman unless you know that she prefers Miss or Mrs. Your correspondence
will be better received when addressed to the correct person and not to
a job title. 
<p><b>Post-contact:</B> Obtain the business card or carefully write out
the name, title, address and phone number of each person during your initial
contact so that you have this information available when you plan your
follow-up activities. </P>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Decide the focus of your
letter, tailor your information to the reader, and ensure that all the
points keep on topic. Base your correspondence to employers around what
you can do for them, not on what you want an employer to do for you. One
page is the maximum for letters. Let your enthusiasm be apparent. You do
not want to lose the reader's interest before the person finishes the page.
Avoid the words, &quot;as you can see&quot;, because the reader may not
be able to &quot;see&quot; the point the way you do.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Check your first draft for
the number of times you have written &quot;I&quot;. Overuse of &quot;I&quot;,
monotony of sentence structure, and rambling, boring text defeat your goal
of writing an effective letter. Try to limit your paragraphs to no more
than four or five sentences and your sentences to a maximum of two lines.
The first sentence in a paragraph introduces the topic to be covered in
that paragraph. </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Send an original, not copies
that look mass-produced. Keep a copy of your correspondence. Follow up
at the appropriate time as the person to whom you have written may not
contact you. Create letterhead and business cards for yourself, if you
can do them well. If not, have a business service prepare them for you.
You will appear to be more serious and professional in your work search.</FONT></FONT></P>

<center><p><b><font size=+2>COVER AND BROADCAST LETTERS</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>A <b>COVER</B> or <b>BROADCAST</B>
letter accompanies your resume to introduce you to a prospective employer
as a knowledgeable and capable applicant. You may wish to send your application
package by overnight delivery to show the urgency and importance you place
on being of service to the company.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0><b>COVER</B> letters are
used when applying to a specific, advertised position. Only 20% of the
positions available at any one time are advertised (&quot;visible&quot;
job market), so do not limit yourself to these jobs. The position you want
may not be advertised for a long time, if ever. You will have many competitors
also trying to obtain an interview. In fact, 90% of all job seekers are
applying to the 20% of advertised jobs. </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0><b>BROADCAST</B> letters,
directed at unadvertised jobs, inform managers of your credentials for
future consideration. Where are all those jobs that are not advertised?
The jobs in this &quot;hidden&quot; job market can be found most easily
by speaking with people. Locate them by research using directories, newspapers,
periodicals, professional organizations, and the Internet. Check out opportunities
in business, industry, social service, education, and government. For more
information, review the Job Search section in this Manual. Most people
want to help you if they can, so ask for their assistance. Through your
inquiries, you should be able to get the names and addresses of people
who hire for the work you would like to do. Personally visit with these
potential employers, or telephone them to arrange an appointment. If either
method is not possible or feasible, your third alternative is a letter
requesting a brief meeting.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>STRATEGIES</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Apply for the position if
you think you can do the job. The ideal candidate may not be available.
&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>

<center><table border=5 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=2 width="85%">
<tr>
<td>The quality of your letter will determine the employer's first impression
of you. Before you begin to compose your cover or broadcast letter, review
your thorough analysis of the job you want to apply for and also of yourself
so that you can make a comparison. What are your strengths? Based on your
research of the organization, what competitive advantage do you have to
offer to the employer? Why would you want to work there? You will then
be able to personalize your information because you will be writing to
a specific organization.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Include only <b>relevant</B>
information, particularly on your experience (paid and volunteer), education,
accomplishments, and personal attributes required by the job in areas such
as procedures, processes, equipment, technology. The letter highlights
the most important information for that particular employer while your
resume is more comprehensive.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Write down ideas as you think
of them. Then analyze the material, organize it into themes, and write
in complete sentences incorporating those themes into paragraphs. Stress
the contributions you can make to the employer. Stress your achievements
and how they are transferable to the job you are applying for. From your
research or the advertisement, note words such as &quot;required, must
have, very desirable, proficient in&quot;, and pay special attention to
pointing out your strengths in these areas. Use action verbs, but do not
repeat verbatim what is in your resume. Avoid using negative words or mentioning
negative ideas. Stress the qualifications you have for the job rather than
mention those you do not have. Avoid words such as &quot;although&quot;
and &quot;however&quot; because you will set up a negative statement.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>In a broadcast letter, choose
the phrasing of your job objective carefully. If you are too narrow, you
may not be considered for some positions, but if you are too broad, you
may be perceived as being unfocused or indecisive, just wanting any job.
When sending letters into the hidden job market, don't send hundreds because
you will not be able to do the necessary research. The response rate does
not justify the time and cost. Concentrate initially on 15-20. Then expand
to the next group of 15-20. More organizations are using equipment to scan
resumes into their database. You can therefore increase the number of names
on your mailing list, but only to the quantity of quality applications
you can produce.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Type or word process your
letters on good quality 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; paper (same stock as your
resume if you prefer). Ensure a neat, uncluttered and well-organized appearance.
Edit your draft for clarity, tone, accuracy, proper spelling, punctuation
and grammar.</FONT></FONT></P>

unfolded in a large envelope.</FONT></FONT></P>

BETWEEN COVER AND BROADCAST LETTERS</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Cover and broadcast letters
are <b>similar</B>, and you should include the following elements:</FONT></FONT></P>

<ul>
<li><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Focus on your strengths
for the job, highlighting them in such a way that the employer can clearly
see a connection with that organization. Interpret or elaborate upon your
qualifications. Give proof, using examples with specifics such as $s or
#s to show that your assessment of your capabilities is accurate. <b>Differentiate
yourself from your competitors for the position.</B> The employer needs
to be motivated to want to meet with you in a job interview.</FONT></FONT></LI>

<li><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Be positive and self confident
but not egotistical: let the facts speak for themselves.</FONT></FONT></LI>

you want to do before sending the letters as it is more important to be
prompt (within 1-2 days).</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Acknowledge in writing your

openings are and who is hiring, or who referred you to others who can help.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Thank those who have agreed
to provide references for you or otherwise speak on your behalf. (Make
sure you know the type of information they will say about you. Is it accurate
and complimentary?) Always keep this group of people informed about your

advise these people of the type of position and organization with whom
you had your interview. Then they will be able to tailor their information

LETTER</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Inform the employer when
you decide that you no longer want the job so that you can be removed from
the active list of candidates. An employer will therefore not have to spend
time and money trying to locate you to be told you are not interested.
You will make it possible for the employer to concentrate on other applicants
who do want the work.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>State your appreciation for

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Write a tactful, friendly
letter thanking the employer for the job offer and expressing regret that
you will not be able to accept their offer at this time.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Include, if you wish, information
on the aspects you preferred in the job you did accept but which were not
present in the job you declined, e.g., more customer contact, more writing
and editing, more research and development in xyz. Avoid negative overtones
so that an employer's goodwill towards you and their high regard for you
will be maintained. It will be easier to re-apply for work in the future.</FONT></FONT></P>

the position and reiterate all terms discussed during the interview period
so that any misunderstanding can be cleared away before beginning the first
day of work. Include a brief paragraph mentioning why you believe the employer
made the right decision.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>State the title of the position
you will be assuming and the starting date. Confirm all arrangements agreed
upon during the interview, e.g., salary, car allowance, stock options,
reimbursement of moving expenses. Add any other particulars that may be
important.</FONT></FONT></P>
