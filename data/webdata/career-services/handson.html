<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>One of the best ways to find
out if a particular type of work is suited to you is to do it. There are
several ways: part-time or full-time <b>paid</B> work, short-term or long-term
<b>volunteer</B> work. The auspices can be through co-operative education,
casual, summer, contract, on-going (permanent), work-study, internship,
or volunteer positions. In addition to the job content knowledge you gain,
there are extra benefits:</FONT></FONT></P>

<ul>
<li><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>referrals for future jobs
through a network that you build</FONT></FONT></LI>

<li><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>knowledge of the strengths
and weaknesses of your work-related skills</FONT></FONT></LI>

<li><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>development of communication,
leadership, analytical, organizational, problem-solving and creative skills</FONT></FONT></LI>

<li><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>demonstration of your initiative,
and establishment of a track-record, for potential employers.</FONT></FONT></LI>
</UL>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Whatever your job is, take
time to reflect on your experiences. Write your thoughts in a journal to
keep a permanent record. What is the work being done? How is the work being
done? When? How quickly? By whom? What interpersonal relationships are
there that help or impede progress? What are you having fun doing? What
do you find boring? Are your surroundings and interactions typical of the
workplace you want for your career-related job? Has this work experience
raised a question about your program of academic studies? When it comes
time to choose your next series of courses, broaden your investigation
into what’s available. Is there something even more suited to your present
needs and the direction you are choosing to go in?</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>With a complete analysis
of your experiential learning, you will have data and examples for your
next resume, portfolio, and job interview.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Co-operative Education</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Co-operative education provides
you with the opportunity to have paid employment in positions that complement
your academic program. Alternating work and study terms takes somewhat
longer than the traditional method of study with a summer break. Co-op
positions are full-time, usually for 4-8 months, or 1 year. The advantage
for you is in having a formal structure through which you can try out different
jobs to see what you like and are good at. With regular performance evaluations
by your supervisors, you can acquire an employer’s perspective on how well
you measure up to the quality of other people working in that position.
You can begin to see your competitive advantage. By taking positions with
increasing levels of responsibility, you will have a solid resume with
which to approach the job market for a full-time position. </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Develop learning objectives
in consultation with your supervisor. Monitor your progress, and make changes
to your goals and strategies, if necessary. With a commitment to lifelong
learning now required of everyone, you can develop good habits that will
last you a lifetime. You can demonstrate that you are able to select appropriate
personal and career-related projects as preparation for your next assignment.
A work report may also be required during the term. You will be able to
look into a topic at greater depth. In addition to the knowledge and skills
you will obtain, the exercise will help you clarify your thoughts as you
identify the components of your ideal job.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Casual Employment</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>While most people take casual
employment part-time any time throughout the year to earn money, there
are additional benefits that you can obtain. If you can get work in an
environment you would like to check out, you will have a sense as to compatibility,
e.g., if you have factory assembly-line experience, you may want to try
a fast food outlet to determine if you would prefer a more interactive
environment with people, i.e., having customers constantly around you,
expecting top quality products and services.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Summer, Contract, On-going (Permanent)</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Jobs in these categories
usually are offered on a full-time basis, ranging from 25-30 hours or more
a week. Seen as building blocks to lay the foundation for your career,
working in a diversity of settings will enable you to experience personally,
as well as observe, aspects of employment. By testing, you will come to
know what you like and don’t like, what you’re good at and what areas you
need to develop expertise in. For those of you in an academic program that
is not specifically preparing you for employment as does mechanical engineering,
health promotion, or accounting, you are receiving the added benefits of
gaining work-related skills that employers are seeking. </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0><b>Work-Study</B> </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Within an academic environment,
there may be positions funded by governments, for up to 10 hours a week
over the term, to help students finance their education. Carefully read
the job notices. If the information is vague, phone the person who would
be hiring for the position for more details. Work-study can be an good
way to apply your knowledge in different settings. In addition to helping
you clarify your career goals, you can end up with excellent transferable
skills.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Internship</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>An internship gives you an
opportunity to have a structured experience combining work and learning
in a field you are considering for your career. The work is usually unpaid,
although you may find some positions with a stipend or an hourly rate typical
for that kind of job. The work can be part-time during an academic term,
a full-time block during the weeks between terms, full-time for an academic
term or longer. Usually a professor from your faculty will oversee the
work in conjunction with your employer so that appropriate academic credit
can be given. Even if you succeed in obtaining an internship that will
not result in academic credit, the experience is invaluable in exploring
career possibilities and gaining work skills valued in the marketplace.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Volunteer</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Volunteering allows you to
check out many types of work. Some examples are: animal care, environmental
preservation, health education, marketing, computer programming, management
(by working on a volunteer Board of Directors). </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>You may want to undertake
a special project as a class assignment in a course. Rather than proceeding
only through the theoretical perspective to obtain your academic grade,
perhaps you could locate a group who could benefit from your work. Since
they may not be able to look into a particular topic because of time or
funding, you would be adding value to their organization at the same time
as you would be expanding your knowledge of the workplace by linking an
academic exercise to a real-world application. </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Anyone can volunteer in practically
any organization. Look through the files and directories in Career Services
and the on-campus volunteer centre. Also check out the Volunteer Action
Centre in Waterloo. Call 742-8610 for an appointment. The two questions
you need to answer for yourself are: what would you like to give to the
community, and what would you like to get back in return? For anyone not
able to obtain paid employment to learn about the work world and expand
employable skills, volunteering is beneficial.</FONT></FONT></P>
