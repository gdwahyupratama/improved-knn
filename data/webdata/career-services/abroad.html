Are you one of the 50 000 to 100 000 people (according to Jean-Marc Hachey, author of 
<cite>&quot;The Canadian Guide to Working and Living Abroad&quot;</CITE>)
dreaming about working on a cruise ship, in a refugee camp for
the United Nations, in an Embassy in the Far East or for a private
school in South America?  All of these jobs are possible, but definitely
not easy to come by, so start preparing early.

<a name="section1"><h2>Going international...</H2></A>
<p>International jobs come in many forms, and the amount of time and difficulty
it will take to find the right one for you depends on the type of work you are looking
for.  Short term or seasonal positions will be easier to locate while professional
positions are more difficult to obtain.  An alternative to working overseas can be
working in the national branch of an international company/organization where you
are exposed to foreign business practices, customs, and culture.  This might even include
some travel outside Canada.<p>

<em><strong>An international career is a series of jobs that requires
employees to conduct their work across national borders or between
at least two cultures within a single country. </STRONG></EM></TD>
</TR></TABLE></CENTER>
<p>Why do you want an international job?  What do you see yourself doing overseas?  Do you want
to work only as a means to support your travel in a new country or continent, or do
you consider your international experience as a stepping stone for your career?  Do
you want some fun time away from home or do you want to get seriously involved in
the other country?  A thorough <em>SELF ASSESSMENT</EM> (see workshop) and the following
points will help you to focus your ideas.
<p>
<center><table border cellpadding=10 width="80%"><td><ul>
<li>Do you like to try new foods? 
<li>Do you like to be around people who are different from you? 
<li>Do you speak another language or do you like to learn new words in another language? 
<li>Can you deal with sudden changes or delays? 
<li>Do you consider yourself adventurous and creative? 
<li>Are you willing to take risks? 
<li>Do people think you have a good sense of humour?</UL>

<p>
Being multiculturally aware, multiculturally sensitive and multiculturally
tolerant besides demonstrating a good academic background will give you the leading
edge to work in an international milieu.<p>

<p>Where can you find information about international opportunities?  Using 
the same job search techniques that you learned in the <em>JOB SEARCH</EM>
workshop, you can take full advantage of both traditional and creative ways to find
interesting opportunities.  First, have you identified the type(s) of program(s) and
country(ies)?<p>

<p>The &quot;<a href="abroad.add.resources.html" webstripperlinkwas="abroad.add.resources.html">Additional 
Resources</A>&quot; section and the Work/Study Abroad section
of the Career Resource Centre (CRC) will open more avenues for your search.  Professional
and trade associations, consulates, international student associations on campus (see
Federation of Students listing), ethnic groups or clubs within the community might
provide a wealth of information for you and good opportunities to network (remember
all the tips you got at the NETWORKING workshop?).  Popular international work programs
are IAESTE for technical, science and engineering related jobs - AIESEC for business/commerce
related jobs - and SWAP for general summer jobs.  Some academic exchange programs have
a work component included, so check the listing in the Work/Study Abroad section in
the CRC.  Several departments on campus have connections to work sites abroad which
we may not know about.  Don't underestimate the value of contacting departments on
your own.<p>
<blockquote>The <cite>Sojourns</CITE> computer database (also available
in the CRC) lists a large variety of jobs/internships/volunteer positions all over
the world that could make for excellent international exposure.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<em><strong>Work permits can be real obstacles in your
planning - be patient and persistent. </STRONG></EM></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>
<p>Obtaining visa/work permits can be the biggest obstacle.  Sometimes 
you need to know what approach is most likely to get you a visa before you 
talk to embassies or consulates.  Try to find out what preferred status - 
tourist, businessperson, consultant or specialist - will give you the best and 
quickest result.  Some countries will not let you enter unless you have an 
airline ticket out of the country or a visa to the next one.  Other
countries might ask you for proof of available funds or require that you buy a minimum
of their currency.  Talk to people who have recently been in your country of interest
to get the latest update.  Besides visa/work permit regulations, it will be very important
to get information about health regulations in your country of choice.  Do you need
vaccinations before you leave?  Is there medication to take before your departure?

<em><strong>Resume + handwritten cover letter + personal
information might be expected of you. </STRONG></EM></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>
<p>How to apply to companies/organizations abroad?  As a general rule 
your &quot;Canadian&quot; style resume (did you attend the <em>RESUME + LETTER WRITING</EM>
workshops?) should work well for you.  Put special emphasis on your 
international skills such as languages spoken and/or written, previous international
work/travel or volunteer experience, and dual citizenship etc.  Point out special skills
that will set you apart from other candidates.  If possible, prepare your resume in
the official language of your chosen country and get it checked by a 
professional.  You may be asked to provide personal information like birthdate, 
marital status etc. as other countries have different Human Rights laws than 
Canada, and it is your decision if you want to include this type of 
information or not.  In many European countries the cover letter is hand 
written.  It is strongly suggested that your cover letter be hand written 
(attach a typed copy if your hand writing can't be read) in the language
of the country. 
<p>
Interviewing with an international employer can be a challenge (sign up for the
<em>INTERVIEW</EM> workshops).  Be well prepared.  Read about the country's 
customs, the do's and don'ts and talk to people who have worked in that 
specific region of the world.

<em><strong>Be prepared for culture shock
and take it in stride. </STRONG></EM></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>
<p>Living outside of Canada might be a new experience for you.  Learn as much 
as possible about your new country and its people before you leave.  Books, 
videos, computer based sources, staff at travel agencies, embassies
are good sources of information.  Brush up on your knowledge of current 
affairs - inside and outside your national borders.  Try to get 
names/addresses from other students currently on visits, exchanges, and work 
terms to share experiences with.  Keeping in touch with home through mail, 
fax, e-mail and phone will help you overcome the culture shock you might be 
going through at the beginning of your new adventure.  While this might 
sound negative, remember that the new environment will present you with
many opportunities to grow as a person and will help you develop your international
career. 
<p>
Barry Yeates, who is a consultant in the field of international career and foreign
service, offers the following advice for starters:
<p>
<blockquote>&quot;My subjective recommendations as to courses to take and must items
to read for students seeking international opportunities are as follows: COURSES: Canadian
history and politics, 20th century foreign policies (no theory!), international organizations,
macro and development economics, international business and finance, any literature
or culture course available on the country or region of interest, and a language;
READING: <cite>The Globe and Mail</CITE> (daily) and the <cite>Economist </CITE>(weekly).&quot;
