<center><h2><b>CONSIDER AN INTERNSHIP!</B></H2></CENTER>

<h3><b>1.0 WHAT IS AN INTERNSHIP?</B></H3>

An internship is an opportunity for "learning by exposure".  It involves
spending a prearranged period of time, either a few months, a semester, or
a few hours per week during the semester, working (paid or unpaid) in a
field of study or interest.  An internship offers many benefits to both
students and employers.

<p>
For example, students can:
<ul><li>Learn about investment, deposit and trust funds at a major Canadian
bank
<li>Work in public affairs at an embassy abroad
<li>Assist a museum or gallery curator
<li>Edit documents concerning industrial accidents in the Asia-Pacific
region

</UL>
<h3><b>2.0 BENEFITS OF AN INTERNSHIP</B></H3>

<h3><b>2.1	Benefits to students:</B></H3>
<ul>
<li>Gain the (short-term) experience required to facilitate a job
search in the field of your choice
<li>Learn whether or not a particular career is right for you
<li>Acquire or enhance a specific skill set
<li>Learn "soft skills" of working in a professional environment (e.g.
interpersonal skills, coping with office politics)
<li>Get to know prospective employers (consider an internship as a
"long interview")
<li>Obtain academic or other credit for your work

</UL>
<h3><b>2.2	Benefits to employers:</B></H3>
<ul>
<li>Gain an eager, highly-educated workforce at low cost
<li>Maintain a constant source of fresh ideas and insights into your
profession/organization
<li>Fill staffing requirements with very flexible human resources
</UL>

<h3><b>3.0	SUGGESTIONS FOR STUDENTS</B></H3>

These requirements could help bridge the gap between the academic and
professional environment, as well as providing opportunities to reflect on
the learning process.

<h3><b>3.1	Considering and preparing for an internship:</B></H3>
<ul>
<li>Outline your general expectations and learning objectives, i.e.
what you hope to gain from your experience
<li>Describe how your pre-internship skills could assist the
organization you are targeting
Prepare for changes in culture if the internship is international

</UL>

<h3><b>3.2	During the internship:</B></H3>
<ul>
<li>"Teach yourself" - the people with whom you will work are not
primarily interested in teaching; rather they are engaged in meeting the
goals of the firm

<li>Keep a learning journal, systematically recording your experiences
and observations:
	 	<ul>Date
<br>
1. Description of the day's main project
<br>
2. Description of the day's minor tasks
<br>
3. Major achievements/failures in terms of: projects/tasks, people
<br>
4. Compare this with previous efforts
</UL>
A learning journal provides an excellent historical record (for the next
resume) and helps with writing a final report

</UL>

<h3><b>3.3	After the internship:</B></H3>

<ul><li>If you have negotiated for credit, prepare reports/presentations
that summarize or reflect on your experiences

<li>For example, the report could be about 2500-5000 words, including:
<ul>1. Background information about the organization
<br>
2. Details of your responsibilities and contributions
<br>
3. Lessons you have learned (e.g., business methodology, comments, etc.)
<br>
4. Relation of the internship to your future career goals
<br>
5. Supporting material (e.g., documents, charts, appendices)

</UL></UL>

<h3><b>4.0	SUGGESTIONS FOR EMPLOYERS</B></H3>
<ul>
<li>Match the position to student's academic or general interests
<li>Outline the nature of the tasks the student will be responsible for
and optional projects they may wish to become involved with
<li>Provide an atmosphere that allows "supervised learning", whereby
the student can progress on the job as quickly as possible with someone
available to answer questions and provide general guidance
<li>Ensure that the University's requirements are met (e.g., regarding
length and quality of internship, reporting methods) so that the student
can obtain any possible academic credit
<li>Correspond with the semester schedule (January-April, May-August,
September-December) OR arrange for part-time work during the term or on
semester breaks
<li>Establish criteria for performance evaluation and make the student
aware of these at the beginning of the internship
<li>	Evaluate competencies of interns and structure assignments accordingly

</UL>

<h3><b>5.0	SOURCES OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE</B></H3>

While some internships are very well-paid, many are not and are frequently
on a volunteer basis.  However, there are several opportunities for
financial assistance:

<h3><b>5.1	Loan deferments:</B></H3>

<ul><li>If you are able to maintain student status or complete an
internship of less than six month's duration, you remain exempt from
Ontario/Canada student loan repayments.  This usually also applies to
private student loans

</UL>
<h3><b>5.2	University assistance</B></H3>

<ul><li>Arts Co-op: Community and World Service Fellowship (Contact Arts
Special Programs Office)
<li>Peace and Conflict Studies/Conrad Grebel College: assistance is
available to students completing this program

</UL>

<h3><b>5.3	Outside assistance:</B></H3>

Various external sources are available to help defray expenses.
<ul>e.g.	Northern Scientific Training Program (NTSP) helps pay for travel to
Northern Canada and modest living expenses
</UL>

<h3><b>6.0	GUIDELINES WHILE "ON INTERNSHIP"</B></H3>


<h3><b>6.1	Objectives of an internship:</B></H3>
<ul>
<li>Further the development of a central core of attitudes, strategies,
skills and information in a workplace setting
<li>Integrate theory and practice related to your aspirations and
society in general
<li>Sharpen professional skills
<li>Utilize the knowledge gained from academic programs
<li>Explore career possibilities
<li>Expand critical evaluative and intellectual skills
<li>Immerse yourself in the work environment of another culture

</UL>

<h3><b>6.2	"In the field":</B></H3>
<ul>
<li>Be prepared to sort out all relevant information for yourself
instead of having it presented to you
<li>Determine the scope and content of your internship together with
your supervisor
<li>Seize the opportunity to acquire substantial knowledge of a
particular discipline, which in turn enhances academic or professional
knowledge
<li>Remember that internships have "real" consequences (e.g., in terms
of money,  customer service)

</UL>

<h3><b>6.3	"Expectations":</B></H3>
<ul>
<li>Try everything possible to gain a cultural and social perspective
on the firm in addition to learning, practicing and integrating specific
professional knowledge and skills
<li>Demonstrate enthusiasm, flexibility, initiative, and tact

</UL>

<h3><b>6.4	Orient yourself to the host organization:</B></H3>

<ul><li>Remember:  "You are a guest who has been invited to participate in
the life of a firm"
<li>Orient yourself physically and socially (everyone may not
understand your role)
<li>Be assertive
<li>Keep a positive attitude
<li>Test out your suitability for this profession as thoroughly as possible
<li>Respect deadlines and deal with problems as they arise
<li>Develop a portfolio of your work
<li>Ask for performance-related feedback
<li>Interview your colleagues for career-related information

</UL>

<h3><b>7.0	DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AN INTERNSHIP AND CO-OP</B></H3>

Whereas a co-op term may involve learning through performing a specific
role set aside for a student within the organization, internships may be
more loosely structured.  One does not preclude the other; co-op students
are often given credit for internships.  However, an internship is ideal
for "regular" students who choose not to take part in the work-study cycle
of co-op, or want to experience something directly related to their studies
that cannot be found on a regular work term.

<p>
An internship should provide students with a strong sense of purpose.  They
should also benefit from the "synergy" that comes from a sponsor's
willingness to teach them.

<h3><b>8.0	UNIVERSITY SPONSORED INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS</B></H3>

Internship placements are available through some departments at the
University of Waterloo.  In many cases, where credit for a specific
internship is not available, it may still be possible to use material from
the internship as part of an independent study or reading course.  Check
with your undergraduate advisor to see if this might be possible. The
following is a listing of departments that currently have internship
programs:

<p>
The <b>Drama</B> Department offers credit for significant involvement (70 hours of
rehearsal time and up) in production work, usually following completion of
Drama 243 and 244 (Introduction to Technical Production 1 and 2).  For more
information, contact William Chesney, Director of Production, Ext. 3685.
<p>

<b>Environment and Resource Studies</B> offers students the opportunity to receive
credit for internship work, either on- or off-campus. For more information,
contact Sally Lerner, Ext. 3060.
<p>

<b>Math </B>students can participate in a program of Undergraduate Summer Research
Awards, sponsored by the Faculty and the various departments.  High
academic standing is a prerequisite.  For more information, contact the
Dean's Office or Math Undergraduate Office.  As well, students have the
opportunity to work as teaching assistants during the term.
<p>

Students of<b> Peace and Conflict Studies</B>, as well as <b>Members and Associates
at Conrad Grebel College</B>, may obtain credit for Field Study work in Peace
and Conflict Studies. For more information, contact Ronald Mathies, Field
Study Advisor, Telephone (519) 885-0220, Ext. 262
