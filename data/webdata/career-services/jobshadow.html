<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>You have read about and talked
with others about a particular type of work. You think that it would be
a good fit for your interests and capabilities, but you would like to do
one more check. That is when the Job Shadow experience is very beneficial.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>To locate the ideal person,
use the same strategy you did to find a person with whom you did an information
interview. Writing or telephoning to make arrangements to meet is similar,
except that you will ask for a &frac12;-day or an entire day. During that
time together, you are able to ask similar questions to those in the information
interview. The bonus is spending time with your contact as that person
does whatever needs to be done that day on the job. You can observe, perhaps
even help.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>By the time you are ready
to leave, you should have good notes about the components of the job, the
work environment, the interactions with other people, and a tally on what
you like and dislike about the position. If the fit is not as good as you
had hoped, ask your contact if there would be a different type of place
where that kind of work would be done, e.g., market research talking with
people in a shopping mall vs. over the telephone.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Within 1-2 days after your
visit, write your thank-you letter and mail it. Include points about what
you found helpful. Whether you have made a decision to work in the field
is not important to your contact, only that the time spent with you was
not a waste.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>
