<center><p><b><font size=+2>DECISION MAKING</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<p>After completing steps 1 and 2, you should be able to make some decisions
on your long-term and short-term goals. But first a few words about the
decision-making process itself. There is a saying that a person spends
much more time choosing a car than a career. Because of the importance
of making the right choice in a job, do the following steps.</P>

<center><table border=5 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=2 width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Define the decision to be made, e.g.,where to work after graduation.</LI>

<li>Consider the choices and predict the consequences of each, e.g., sales—may
be difficult to get into research later.</LI>

<li>Compare and prioritize alternatives as defined in a specific, not vague,
way, e.g., #1—grad school after 2 years work experience in X environment.</LI>

<li>Select and outline a realistic yet demanding plan, e.g., set up an
appointment to speak with Mr. A next week about becoming a mentor.</LI>

<li>Put the plan into action.</LI>

<li>Evaluate the results, e.g., received excellent information on importance
of picking the right people as references.</LI>

</TABLE>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Now that you have thought
about yourself (Step 1: Self Assessment) and about the different types
of work (Step 2: Occupational Research), the time has come for you to set
some career objectives. If you knew you could not fail, what’s the first
job that comes to your mind? Name 2-3 other options below.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Are you surprised at what
you put on the page? Or does this type of work confirm what you have been
thinking? This is the time to make a commitment. In order to begin the
next phase, you need to have a sense of direction, some goals to work toward.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Organize your ideas into
the following 3 groups. By having longer-term goals, you will be able to
set your course to becoming successful in your career. Then by working
backwards to the present, you will be able to take a step at a time toward
your ultimate goal.</FONT></FONT></P>

<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Work I would like to be doing in 2-5 years</TD>

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF">Work I would like to be doing <b>now</B></TD>

<td>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>How much of your total being
(body, mind, spirit) do you want to commit to the work you have listed
in the &quot;now&quot; column? Will you be able to see this work as part
of the big picture, the dreams you have, your special way of contributing
to the world? Receiving pay from an employer means completing the tasks
required by the position. Will the joy you experience be greater than the
burdens?</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Your personality and attitudes
are the most important predictors of your success in your career and in
your life generally. You can’t accomplish more than you believe you can.
Your thoughts, positive or negative, come into existence (self-fulfilling
prophecy). The only limits you have will be those you accept on your own
abilities. The secret of an athlete’s success can be yours too. Create
a mental model, e.g., a high jumper will visualize running and sailing
over the bar in the competition. Use your imagination to create what you
want in life. Close your eyes and visualize yourself doing the work you
have written in the &quot;now&quot; section above. Are you inside or outside?
Is there anyone with you? What tools or equipment are you using? What are
you saying, writing, or thinking? What deadline are you working towards?
To be successful in visualizing your work, you need to have a strong <b>desire</B>
for the goal to be achieved, a <b>belief</B> that it is possible to attain,
and a <b>willingness</B> to live with the outcome. </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Complete your visualization
with an affirmation (in the present tense of the verb as though it already
exists). &quot;I am ....&quot; You can phrase it as a role, e.g., a customer
support representative, or as an activity, e.g., supervising volunteers.
Say the affirmation so often that the thought becomes very comfortable
and exciting for you. Finding this type of work is so much easier when
you can describe it to others.</FONT></FONT></P>
