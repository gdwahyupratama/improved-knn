</TR></TABLE></CENTER><p><font size=+0>With the changing nature of the workplace, concerns about
the future have been expressed by many individuals, both those preparing
to start a career and those having to adjust to job changes and job losses.
Stable and secure positions have disappeared. The future of work itself
is being debated. Organizations have relinquished the responsibility for
employees' professional development.<b> You have been put in charge of
your own career.</B> Managing it will be a lifelong process. Discover your
place in the world where you will be able to enjoy a high level of wellness.
Choose work that will be compatible with your own unique skills, knowledge,
personality, and interests. Define the balance that you would like to have
with your work, finances, health, and relationships with family, friends
and colleagues. </FONT></P><p>
<font size=+0><b>Be proactive!</B> Don't just react to whatever chance
or luck brings your way.</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>Your success depends upon understanding the changing nature
of jobs and careers. Be aware of trends, both local and global. Big companies
are getting smaller-they are downsizing and delayering, thereby reducing
the number of promotions potentially available. Companies are giving off
functions to their suppliers, outsourcing, or entering into joint ventures,
opening up opportunities for entrepreneurs. With existing technology, many
small businesses can compete in the international marketplace just as easily
as multinational corporations do. It is anticipated that many emerging
careers will generate fewer new positions than in the past. Fields experiencing
major growth will demand job applicants with specific academic majors and work experience. Some academic programs will have limited options for employment.  For those graduates, it may be necessary to get additional preparation
through special courses or a second degree.</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>In addition to whatever academic background they specify,
employers say they are looking for a person who is an independent decision-maker
and self-managed learner, with a positive work attitude, a well-rounded
education with math and computer literacy, communication skills including
good use of words and grammar, interpersonal and time management skills,
flexibility, and dependability. <b>Employers seem to be more interested
in what you have done with your talents than on what talents you possess.</B>
Your resume then is a testimony to &quot;I have accomplished ...&quot;
rather than &quot;I am ....&quot; Whether you are self-employed or an employee,
acting in a more enterprising way will give you a competitive edge.&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>To get fewer rejections and better results, <b>enter the
job market with marketable skills</B>. Follow a &quot;customer-driven&quot;
approach. You will need to make sales presentations about yourself to potential
buyers, possibly from all over the world. It's hard to sell a product or
service if you are not confident in it and cannot see the value to the
purchaser. Therefore, believe in yourself and show the benefits you offer.
Polish your presentations and deliver them enthusiastically to the right
market. One caution, weigh the need for the employer to contact you with
your need for safety and privacy when you go public with your credentials,
particularly when using the Internet. Carefully select the type of workplace
to fit your needs. Some work environments provide great financial rewards
but require long hours and produce high stress levels. Some organizations
encourage employees to be creative and take risks on one hand but then
show displeasure when staff question existing procedures. Some workplaces
create conditions that permit the body, mind and spirit to thrive allowing
employees to perform better. &nbsp;</FONT></P>

<p><font size=+0>Attitude is how you respond to situations in your life.
Keep a sense of humour. Don't worry about the future! Prepare! Visualize
satisfying work, and expend your energy on locating customers who have
needs you can fulfill. <b>Develop goals and strategies to make your dreams
come true.</B> The <i>Career Development Manual</I> has been prepared to
guide you through the necessary steps, whether you are looking for your
1<sup>st</SUP> job or your 21<sup>st</SUP>. Begin now with Step 1, Self
Assessment.</FONT>
