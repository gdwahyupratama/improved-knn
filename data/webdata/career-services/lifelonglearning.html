<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Change is everywhere in the
world, in companies and in organizations. Individuals will need to change
to keep pace. That means continuous learning and updating—an ongoing adjustment
to your portfolio of skills and knowledge. Motivation can come from several
benefits: increased job satisfaction, better prospects for work, personal
satisfaction, and increased pay. Settings could include: (1) training at
your place of employment; (2) learning at home through audio/video tapes,
computer instruction, printed materials; and (3) day or evening courses
in the community or at an educational institution. Before you invest your
time and money, thoroughly investigate your options regarding quality and
suitability to your needs. For some programs you may wish to ask about
the people who graduated, what type of work they are doing and their salary
ranges. Because of the wide array of programs and courses, you may wish
to consult an educational specialist or a guidance/career/training counsellor.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Challenge, commitment, control
and being connected make up the 4 C’s of conquest. To move forward, you
must have a <b>challenge</B> that will stretch your present capabilities.
Irrespective of how nice it would be to have what you desire, nothing will
happen unless you make a <b>commitment</B> with your heart and your mind.
You need to take <b>control</B>, to be a proactive rather than a passive
learner. It’s hard doing something alone—being <b>connected</B> to others
for support and encouragement will help stave off those feelings of wanting
to give up.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>First, you need to do a reality
check. Truthfully, evaluate your current interest in lifelong learning
and professional upgrading. Rate yourself on the scale between high and
low.</FONT></FONT></P>

<table border=5 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=2 width="100%">

</TABLE>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Did you put your mark on
either of the first two bars on the high side? If you didn’t, you will
need to think seriously about the type of work you are interested in doing
and the amount of learning that will be expected of you to keep current.
Are they compatible? Both you and your employer will become frustrated
if the gap between their expectation and your capacity is too large. You
may have other priorities which preclude the dedication necessary.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>ESTABLISHING A LEARNING PLAN FOR A UNIVERSITY
EDUCATION<br>
</B><font size=+0>(Principles can be adapted to college or other educational
institutions.)</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Many students enrol in an
academic institution without having a goal. They complete their education
with no other plans than to get a degree or diploma. They take courses
in what they love to learn and become more well-rounded. Then they are
disappointed at graduation time to find that no employer wants to hire
them because they don’t have the knowledge or skills to be productive immediately
on the job. Unfair as that sounds, that is the reality that some students
face. Enjoying your studies is excellent. Becoming more well-rounded is
excellent. But you need to think about that third component: your arsenal
of hireable talents, abilities, skills, knowledge. Is hireability important?
</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>The initial question then
is what do you want your university education to do for you. Write a few
notes in the space below so that you will have your wishes on record. </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">GRADUATE SCHOOL</FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Are you wrestling with the
question of whether you should go to graduate school or get a job? Don't
decide to go <b>only</B> because you don't want to look for a job. Years
of commitment in a Master's or Ph.D. program require a strong interest
in the subject area. You need to feel the activity is an <b>investment
in your future</B>. You may also find that you become overqualified for
the job you eventually would like to do. Unless the positions you are interested
in require advanced level education, e.g., Psychology, Scientific Research,
make sure you have adequate experience in the work world first, for two
reasons: some graduate schools require work experience prior to enrolling
in their programs, and some employers will not hire anyone without experience
especially when having to pay a premium for an educational level they do
not want. An option that might work out better for you is part-time study.
Some employers partially fund costs for employees continuing their education.
Your studies may seem more interesting and relevant, especially if your
projects can have a real-world application.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>When it comes time to consider
graduate school, research information and speak with knowledgeable people.
Entering the wrong program or the wrong school can also derail your career.
If you want to work with a particular company and you know they hire graduates
from only 1 or 2 schools, then you need to get your credentials from that
institution. If the work you would love to do requires a special graduate
program, but it is offered in an area you don’t want to move to, are you
prepared to settle for second-best type work in your career by choosing
an alternate program and school? Your reputation upon graduation is as
good as your adviser’s. Therefore, choose your school, program and adviser
very carefully. What debt level are you prepared to carry at the end of
your studies? Are you able to find studies that will also fund you? What
is the record for graduates in obtaining their desired employment? For
those interested in obtaining an academic position, how many years of post-doctoral
study have they had to undertake?</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Job markets fluctuate. It
is very difficult to predict what positions will be available in 5 to 10
years. You need to keep a balance between the work you care very deeply
about and the probability of earning a living in that field.</FONT></FONT></P>

<td><b>Observations almost 25 Years after graduating from UW</B> 
<p>It may well be presumptuous on my part to think I can give you advice
on what to do with your life.<br>
Perhaps what I can do, for what it may be worth, is give you some of my
thoughts.<br>
Most readers will align themselves with one of the two following categories:</P>

<ul>
<li><b>you have a career already picked out; you know where you are going
and what you must do to get there; you may have known for many years, and
feel it is an advantage since it can save you a lot of turmoil;</B></LI>

<li><b>you have no idea what you want to do; a lot of things cross your
mind, but you can't get really excited about any one of them.</B></LI>
</UL>

<p>In the latter case, you have a problem! It should not be ignored or
neglected, and it is not futile, for much can be done. Do not allow such
an important issue to drift - <b>your career is important.</B> When you
look back in later years you will realize what a very significant portion
of your total time and energy is dedicated to your chosen work. Like it
or not, North American society judges people significantly by &quot;what
they do&quot;. More importantly, it will be a source of much satisfaction
or frustration, dependent on making a choice or evolving toward a career
that is comfortable for you.</P>

<p>Here are some thoughts:</P>

<ul>
<li><b>It is okay not to know.</B> It happens to many of us and need not
be an impediment to long-term success, accomplishment and satisfaction.</LI>

<li><b>Sit down and start a list of possibilities.</B> You may want to
evaluate them against at least two criteria: </LI>

<ul>
<li>potential/security/compensation and reward </LI>

<li>satisfaction/challenge/interest/contribution </LI>
</UL>

<p>Both may be important to you, and that's fine. But if you are in doubt,
I advise using the second category as the most important by far. If you
get the second right, the first often follows.</P>

<li><b>Imagine non-traditional careers (lots of them) and put them on your
list.</B></LI>

<li><b>Do some research-worthwhile things rarely fall into our laps.</B>
Talk to people who have succeeded in various areas to find out what they
are like. Call people in <b>senior positions </B>even if you don't know
them-they will only rarely not agree to talk to you. This is very important,
so put some energy into it. Success in life comes at least as much from
perseverance as ability.</LI>

<li><b>If all your effort to reach a decision fails, it may be necessary
to start out simply, by trying other things. </B>Be aware that this has
some additional risk attached-with the passage of years it can become difficult
to make changes. <b>So if you don't like it, don't start it.</B></LI>

<li><b>Much of what you will need to know is not taught formally at university.</B>
Are you <b>&quot;learning how to learn&quot;?</B> If unsure, start a debate
with your classmates and professors. Make sure you are picking up technology
skills (computer literacy), speaking, reading and writing skills. Read
lots of challenging material. Much of this will necessarily come outside
of formal classroom work and you will never have a better opportunity to
get started than now.</LI>

<li><b>Even if you have a well defined career path and know exactly where
you're going, make sure you get a broadly based &quot;liberal&quot; education.</B>
Study philosophy or history or languages or mathematics, or, better yet,
all of them.</LI>
</UL>

<p>Finally, if you pursue what you want with enough focus, you are highly
likely to get it, so don't compromise. You will learn you can make anything
happen. An old boss and mentor of mine once told me (and meant it) as I
prepared for an important job interview: &quot;You can do everything&quot;.
I have discovered I can do anything; I haven't yet gone after everything.
