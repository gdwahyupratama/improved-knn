</UL>


<center>
<h3><b>Notes on Writing a Curriculum Vitae</B></H3>
</CENTER>
<ul><li>Place sections in the order of importance of the
information about you.  If you are not sure about the traditional
formatting for C.V.s in your field, check with your supervisor or
department chair.  Also, include specific sections which are relevant to
your field, e.g., computer proficiency, scientific instrumentation, etc.
<li>Include sufficient, well-written detail about yourself to
enable a good assessment of your qualifications for the position:
<ul><li>2 to 4 pages for a young professional
<li>4 to 7 pages for a person with more experience
<li>10 pages as a maximum.
</UL>
<li>Omit reference to marital status, children, health,
spouse's work, religious affiliation.
<li>Do not include as headings, words such as "Personal
Information", "Name", "Address".
<li>Omit negative words or information.  Ensure that you use
correct spelling and grammar.  Take care to produce an excellent physical
product with appropriate font sizes, paper stock and good laser printing.
<li>Update the information in your C.V. before sending.  It is
not necessary to include the date of preparation; however, if you think it
would be helpful to you or to those receiving your C.V., add the date at
the top of the first page.

</UL>
<center><h3><b>RESEARCHING THE JOB</B></H3></CENTER>

<ul><li>Before applying for a position, determine your fit to the
area where the job vacancy occurs.
<li>It would be helpful if you could do some preliminary
research about the department and institution prior to sending your
application so that you do not put emphasis in the wrong place.  Are
teaching and research of equal importance?  What other duties are expected?
Prior to arriving for an interview for that position, it is essential to
find out as much as you can so that you will be able to present your
credentials as effectively as possible.

</UL>
<center><h3><b>COVER OR BROADCAST LETTERS</B></H3></CENTER>


<ul><li>How can you differentiate yourself from the many good
applicants applying for the position?  What points will draw attention to
you as a worthwhile candidate to interview?  There is a fine line between
projecting yourself positively and too aggressively, however, resulting in
overkill and a concern about your ability to fit into the department.
<li>Personalize your letter by addressing it to the Chair of
the Department, with the person's name correctly spelled.  A form letter is
less well received, and you may therefore need to make a decision on the
quantity vs. the quality of your letters.
<li>Ensure the highest quality of information possible in the
letter accompanying your C.V.   Include a mission statement about your
objective in clear, unambiguous points.  Discuss your strengths and area of
specialization.  Observe the rules of good writing to help the reader to
ascertain your credentials quickly.  Write shor=04=D8S=10=00=00=00=00=00=00=
=D0=DD=04=BE=03@h a clear
op=04=82=CD-g sentence to define the topic of the paragraph and highlight
relevant, important information.  Use correct spelling and grammar.
<li>In addition to talking about your current research, include
a one-paragraph or one page, personalized (not vague or generic), concise,
coherent statement about your future research interests or long-term goals
so that your potential can be determined.  It is especially important to
make that connection when you are applying for a job which is somewhat
different from what you are currently doing.
<li>It could also be to your advantage to mention the
courses/general areas you would like to teach.  Elaborate on your
experience in seminars, lectures and talks.  Include details such as course
name (and description if necessary) and number of students.
<li>Add information on what you feel are other strengths, such
as enjoyment in working with groups, obtaining funding for projects,
action-oriented research.
<li>Your potential for service (the third part of the
triumvirate of research, teaching and service) and your collegiality can
more easily be evaluated by including details of your work with clubs,
organizations and committees, e.g., organizing graduate student seminars or
journal club.
<li>When you are applying to an advertised position or when you
are writing to an institution you are very interested in to inquire about
possible openings, you may wish to include with your letter a reprint of 2
or 3 papers published or presented at a convention to provide more
information about your capabilities.
<li>If you are a new graduate, you may also want to enclose a
photocopy of your transcript(s).
<li>The individuals reviewing your application are interested
in continuity.  If you have unexplained gaps in your C.V., discuss them in
your letter, e.g., the ten years it took to finish your Ph.D. after
completing your Master's degree.  If you prefer, you could ask one of your
referees to explain the situation in his/her letter of recommendation.
However, patch up the holes as well as you can to make a good presentation.
<li>Should you have a major health-related issue which should
be introduced at the time you send in your application, discuss the
situation briefly in your letter and mention what has to be done in the
position to overcome the difficulty, or you may prefer to have one of your
referees talk about it on your behalf.
<li>Should you be currently employed and want to apply
confidentially for another position, it is not necessary to tell your
supervisor initially.  The three referees you select can include trusted
colleagues from your organization or individuals from other institutions
who know you and your work well.  In your letter, you could include a note
that when the institution is serious about you and wishes to obtain a
reference from your supervisor, you would then be prepared to supply the
information.
<li>It may be to your advantage, if you are female, to indicate
that fact if your first name cannot easily be identified by the reader.
You could add Miss, Mrs. or Ms. in brackets before your name is typed at
the end of your letter.
<li>Have your application package reviewed by others to check
for relevance and quality of presentation.
</UL>



<center><h3><b>SELECTION PROCESS</B></H3></CENTER>

<ul>
Because of the expense usually incurred when bringing in candidates for an
interview, you may find an institution with an agenda as follows:

<li>The receipt of your application may be acknowledged by a
note which may also inform you of the progress and, if necessary, request
information not included in your package.
<li>One person or several individuals will screen all
applications with a few (10 - 12) promising candidates selected, and the
documentation from the others filed in the "not-of-interest-at-this time"
category.
<li>If letters of reference have not already been sent by their
referees, the promising applicants may be told to have their referees
contact the hiring institution, or the referees may be notified directly by
telephone or letter.  If the person hiring for the position personally
knows someone at the candidate's institution, that person may also be
contacted.
<li>To permit an easier check of your teaching ability if you
are applying for your first full-time position after graduation, you may
wish to include in your C.V. the name of the instructor(s)/co-ordinator(s)
for whom you taught the courses listed in your C.V.
<li>After hearing from the referees, 3 to 6 people are selected
and invited for an interview.
<li>It is advisable to send as complete an application package
as possible as early as you can as some invitations to interview may be
given before the advertised closing date.
<li>The interview day(s) may comprise:
<ul><li>a tour of the institution
<li>appointments with one or more of -
department chair, individual faculty members, department search committee,
dean of faculty
<li>one or more talks, such as a talk to the
department based on your research where you can choose your own topic, and
a lecture to a large introductory level class on a predetermined topic, so
that the relevance of your background and your ability to express ideas can
be determined
<li>"bear pit" session with students usually at
the graduate level
<li>opportunity for informal discussion on a
drop-in basis
<li>social activities.
</UL>
<li>Remember, at all times you are being evaluated.  To be able
to present yourself as well as you can, it may be helpful to find out what
is expected and what the evaluation criteria are, e.g., communication
skills and comfort level in talking with groups.  Ask the person setting up
your schedule questions on the background of those attending talks.  Such
information will enable you to determine how familiar they may be with your
technical data.
<li>It may take 1 to 2 months before a decision is made,
particularly if you are one of the first candidates interviewed.  A job
offer will be extended to the person selected.  Graduating Ph.D. applicants
who are viewed as strong candidates may be offered postdoctoral rather than
tenure-tract positions.
<li>It is helpful to know that most applicants are rejected
because their interests do not seem to match the department's interests or
someone else is viewed as a stronger candidate.

</UL>

<center><h3><b>Addendum</B></H3></CENTER>

A viewpoint was presented by Prof. Keith Thomas in his article entitled,
"Academics and the Sorcerer's Apprentice".  Two paragraphs are quoted with
the author's permission.

<p>
<font size=1>
<ul>	Thirty years ago and more, the people who hired new faculty members
usually looked for certain academic qualities.  A command of the subject
was required, as witnessed by the candidates' performance as students at
university and by their publications, lectures, and presenting of papers.
In particular, perception and discernment were looked for, especially the
ability to penetrate to the heart of a question and to perceive the
relations of the parts to the whole.  At the same time a sense of
proportion was valued, the ability to assess correctly how important each
part is (and not only in what is being studied, but also in the activities
of people in a university).  Industry, of course, was cherished, as were
eagerness to explore the unexplored and the deftness and skill needed to
find a way where no one had gone before.  Equally valued as an alternative
was the ability to perceive and demonstrate error in what had been
traditionally accepted as truth.  Success in communication was likewise
looked for, whether it was achieved through clarity of expression or
evocativeness of style.

<p>
	The people hiring looked for the ability to arouse and maintain
interest, even enthusiasm, for the subject and for the parts of the
discipline being examined.   Sensitivity to nuance, both in the texts
examined and in the students taught, was also required, as was a concern
that students arrive at an understanding and appreciation of their subject
suitable to their level of progress in the discipline.  Likewise required
were fairness and evenhandedness in dealing with works by competing
scholars and critics and in dealing with students.  Equally looked for was
an understanding of the kinds of difficulties students may encounter, and
so was the encouraging of perseverance and the giving of one's best effort.
