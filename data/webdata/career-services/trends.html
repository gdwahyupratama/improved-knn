<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>When making career decisions,
it is important to remember that your choices must fit into the realities
of the working world. However, it is possible to use those same trends
to your advantage, by utilizing those aspects of your personality and experience
which are most compatible with employment demands. </FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Labour Market Trends</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Labour market trends are
those which operate on a macro-scale and determine which employment fields
will be predominant. Examples include advertising, research and development,
information systems management, and social work. By analyzing certain indices
(in sources such as specialized books, business journals, government policies,
even your daily paper and the Internet), you can begin to discern patterns
which you can extrapolate into future employment prospects. Indices you
can watch for include:</FONT></FONT></P>

<ul>
<li><font face="Times New Roman">demographics</FONT></LI>

<li><font face="Times New Roman">technology</FONT></LI>

<li><font face="Times New Roman">economic globalization</FONT></LI>

<li><font face="Times New Roman">domestic economic conditions and policies</FONT></LI>

<li><font face="Times New Roman">state of the environment.</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>A change in any of these
indices has the potential to create new career opportunities or to lead
to the elimination of jobs. The impact of these trends is evident in the
downsizing of the Canadian manufacturing sector, the diversification of
the service sector, and the growth of small business.</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>It will be up to you to gain
a basic understanding of these trends so that you can adjust your career
preparation and take advantage of emerging possibilities. Start your search
for information in Career Services where there is an entire section devoted
to future career and labour market trends, as well as Canadian newspapers
and business magazines. Check out some of the Internet sites as well.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></P>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+1>Occupational Trends</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Occupational trends, which
are more micro-oriented, are concerned with your role <b>within</B> a certain
field. For example, within &quot;advertising&quot;, you can be a full-
or part-time employee of an advertising firm, you can be a freelancer or
contractor, you can job-share, etc. Changing economic conditions are a
major determinant of occupational trends, with events like recessions and
economic restructuring playing important roles. <b>Technological advances</B>
are also significant. One change due to the advent of high-tech tools has
been the increased number of people telecommuting (working from home).</FONT></FONT></P>

<ul>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font size=+0>Therefore, by matching your
strengths and interests with the needs of your field(s) of interest, you
will be able to fulfill your career goals while filling a niche in the
labour market. It is clear that both types of trends must be considered
simultaneously if you are to make the most of your career. You are making
a big investment in preparing for your career, so make sure your skills
will be marketable in the future by keeping up with occupational and labour
market trends.</FONT></FONT></P>
