Winter Storm: A Case Study
</H1>

<H2>
What Is A Case Study?
</H2>

All storms have a story.  The stories are as different as the storms
are.  The characters in a storm story are not people or animals.
Instead, they are weather systems with winds and temperatures and
rain, snow and sunshine.  Places become important, too.
Meteorologists call a storm story a "case study."
<P>

This case study -- or storm story -- is about a winter storm that
dumped a record 19.7 inches of snow on Columbia, Missouri, between
January 18 and January 21, 1995.  It also left 12.6 inches of snow in
Madison, Wisconsin, in a single day.  Other towns had snow records,
too, since the storm had heavy snow and high winds.  It was a very big
and very strong storm.  Besides making a lot of snow, this storm
produced ten tornadoes in the southern United States.

This figure shows the total snowfall in centimeters for the 19 Jan
1995 storm.  Lines connect all points reporting the same snowfall
amounts in centimeters.  Bands of 10 cm snow depth are indicated with
the shading code shown in the table.

How Did The Storm Begin?
</H2>

This storm began in much the same way that many storms begin.  A cold
front ran from Canada down to Texas.  The winds near the cold front
over Texas began blowing in a counterclockwise pattern.

A warm front was found on the East Coast of the United States.  In the
South along the Gulf States, warm humid air made a lot of fog to the
east of the cold front.
<P>

In the northern states along the Canada border, snow was falling in
the cold air.  There was rain from Indiana to the south.  In Texas and
Louisiana, there were thunderstorms and rainshowers.

What About That Upper Air?
</H2>

There is a lot of air above us, much more than we can easily see.  The
air just over the earth is the surface air.  But far above that, is
what meteorologists call "upper air."  We will look at one level near
the earth's surface, which is not quite 5000 feet above the surface in
the Midwest.  This level is near where small planes fly.  The next
level is about 18,000 feet that is about half way up in the region
where most of the weather occurs.  The highest level is about 30,000
feet, where jet aircraft often fly.  This level is where the strong
winds, called the jet stream, can be found.  In the three levels of
upper air, many different weather conditions can be happening at the
same time.  In our storm story, a lot was happening.

Two cyclone patterns were joined by a trough of low air pressure in
the lowest upper air level.  In the next level up, a deep trough of
low pressure led from Canada to Texas.  And in the top level of the
upper air, the low air pressure was surrounded by a region of 115 mile
per hour winds.

On The Surface 12 Hours Later

A low pressure area formed to the east of Texas and moved to the
northeast.  More cyclone winds formed.  Thunderstorms and rain
happened over Mississippi and Louisiana.  As the storm continued to
move northeast and the temperatures cooled, heavy snow began to fall
over Oklahoma and Missouri.
<P>

<H2>
Jumping Back To The Upper Air
</H2>

The low pressure area in the upper air was moving, too.  It was moving
east.  In the lowest level, some strong cyclone wind patterns were
found over Arkansas.  The wind was moving faster here.  In the middle
layer, the low pressure area still ran from Canada to Texas.  In the
highest air level, a thin low pressure area had formed from Canada to
Texas.  Very fast winds called "jet winds" or "jet streams" were
racing alongside the low pressure area.  Some winds were 126 miles per
hour above Texas.

The low pressure area on the surface moved northeast during the night.
By midnight, it had reached Memphis, Tennessee.  Farther south, rain
was still falling in the warm air.  To the north, the areas where it
had been snowing still had snow.
<P>

By the next morning, the cyclone winds were moving north along the
Mississippi River traveling through St. Louis, Missouri.  Winds were
still strong.  Sub-freezing temperatures were near the great Lakes
Region and Plains States.  Snow was falling from southeast Wisconsin
to Iowa, Missouri, and Arkansas.
<P>

The storm reached northwest Indiana by Thursday evening.  Strong
northwest winds pulled cold air toward the south.  The snow belt was
now from northeastern Wisconsin, down the Mississippi River Valley to
southern Missouri and then eastward into western Kentucky.
<P>

By Friday, the low pressure area at the surface was moving east
slowly.  The cold front caught up with the warm front near Cape Cod,
Massachusetts.  Snow was thinning out over the region.

What's Happening Up There?
</H2>

In the upper air regions, some interesting things were happening.  The
low pressure areas in the three levels were moving so that they ended
up stacked like three giant bagels one on top of each other.  By the
time this had happened, the storm was losing strength and the snows
were turning to rain.  By Saturday morning, the storm was over.
