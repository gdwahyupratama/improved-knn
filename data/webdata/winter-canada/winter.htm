<td><font face="Arial">Since most of the province lies on North America's major storm track, winter weather systems travel through Ontario on average every 3 to 5 days. Ontario is the battleground between cold Arctic air invading from the north and the warm moist air pushing up from the Gulf of Mexico. 

<p>In one day, residents, especially those in Southern Ontario, may be drenched by cold winter rain then covered with snow because north winds dropped temperatures to well below freezing.  As the old saying goes...</p>
</font>
<p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><b>&quot;If you don't like the weather, wait a bit...it will change!&quot;</b></font></p>

<font face="Arial">
<p>Ontario winter weather varies day to day and year to year. On Christmas Day in  1980, the people of Toronto shivered in the nose-freezing cold of &#45;25&#176;C. Christmas Day, two years later, Torontonians walked around in sweaters and rain jackets in spring like 17&#176;C temperatures.</p>

<p>Ontario covers so much territory that the average daily temperatures may differ by as much as 20 Celsius degrees. For example, the average daily temperatures in January range from near minus -24&#176;C  in northern portions of the province to a relatively balmy -4&#176;C in southwestern Ontario.</p>

<p><img src="images/coaster.gif" width=150 height=157 border=0 alt="Image Roller Coaster 12kb" align="right">Not surprisingly, most winters begin earlier and end later in the north than in the south. The winter season in Northern Ontario usually starts in October and ends in mid-May. In Southern Ontario, the winter season starts in November and finishes around the middle of April.</p>

<p>We may joke about winter. But winter weather is no joke. Bitter cold and winter storms kill more than 100 people in Canada every year. That is more than the number of Canadians killed by the combined effects of tornadoes, thunderstorms, lightning, floods, hurricanes and heat waves.</p>

<p>In Ontario, Environment Canada issues Special Weather Statements to flag the approach of significant or severe weather. The Special Weather Statement is your first line of defence against hazardous winter weather.  Special Weather Statements are issued for three reasons.</p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>To alert you that severe weather is on the horizon but at least 24 hours away.  In this case, the Special Weather Statement flags the possibility of winter severe weather. The information provided is an overview with few details about the type or amount of precipitation expected and the areas affected.</li> 
 <p><img src="images/thermometer.gif" width=100 height=134 border=0 alt="Image Thermometer" align="right">OR</p>
 <li>To alert you that a weather system of inconvenience is approaching and is 6 to 24 hours away.  In this case, Environment Canada does not expect the  criteria for a weather warning to be reached. But you may be inconvenienced by the weather.</li>
<p>OR</p>
	<li>To alert you that unusual weather is expected. In this case, the Special Weather Statement is issued because of your anticipated interest or concern for safety.  Such weather may include the first real snowfall of the season, thick fog over a wide area, or thunderstorms in February.</li>

<p>Environment Canada issues a winter storm watch as a &quot;heads up&quot; that severe and possibly dangerous weather is expected soon. The approaching weather may affect your safety or at least be inconvenient.  The Winter Storm Watch is your second line of defence.</p>

<p>Two points to remember about winter storm watches:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>Winter storm watches are usually issued 12 to 24 hours in advance of the approaching bad weather.</li>
<p></p>
	<li>Winter storm watches are an alert to the possibility of severe weather.  Please, watch the skies and listen to the radio or television for new developments. Environment Canada will either end the winter storm watch or upgrade it to a winter weather warning, depending on the conditions.</li>

<p>Environment Canada issues winter weather warnings only when severe weather is expected to occur. The weather service tries to provide lead times of 3 to 18 hours.  Environment Canada's warnings are quite specific about the type of weather approaching. Winter Weather Warnings are your third and most important line of defense against severe weather. Please pay attention to them. There are 10 types of winter weather warnings.</p></font>

	<p>Whiteout  is the term used  to describe blizzard-like or blowing snow 	conditions which reduce visibility to a few feet.  People standing in a whiteout 	are unable to see shadows or landmarks and lose all sense of direction, 	perception and sometimes even balance as the land and the sky seem to blend into 	one.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Sleet  is an un-Canadian term that is not part of Environment Canada's 	vocabulary. Americans use this term to the describe a mixture of rain, snow and 	ice pellets usually accompanied by biting winds. The Canadians are wordier and 	mention all precipitation types that may occur at the same time.</p>
