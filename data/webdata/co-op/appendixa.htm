   Appendix A: Regulations and Procedures for Co-operative Programs</H1>
  <H2>
   Seeking Employment and Employer Interviews</H2>
  <UL>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Seeking Employment:</B> Students are expected to seek work term 
    employment through the interview process arranged by Co-operative 
    Education &amp; Career Services (CECS). Students should not seek 
    employment on their own with a participating UW co-op employer unless 
    specific arrangements are made with the Department. Students who wish 
    to arrange their own work term assignment must have the position 
    evaluated and approved by CECS to receive credit.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Job Applications:</B> The maximum number of initial job 
    applications allowed may vary from time to time, depending on the 
    number of job opportunities and students seeking employment. The 
    maximum number will be published in Important Dates and Procedures 
    for Co-op Students and specified during the Co-op 101 program.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    &#183;<B> Release of Information:</B> A file which includes the 
    Co-operative Student Record, examination reports, Employer Evaluation 
    of Co-operative Student forms, records of co-ordinator interviews, 
    etc. is kept on each co-operative student. This confidential file is 
    made available for examination upon the student's proof of 
    identification. No information may be removed from the file.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Missing Interviews: </B>Students are expected to attend all 
    individual interviews granted to them. Students who anticipate 
    missing an interview for just cause should inform the Department 
    immediately so other arrangements can be made. Students who miss 
    interviews without just cause may be withdrawn from the job search 
    program and recorded as &quot;On Own - University Imposed&quot;.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Ranking Employers: </B>During the computer match process, students 
    are required to rank all employers by whom they are interviewed. 
    Ranking an employer indicates an agreement to work with that employer 
    if matched by the program. Refusal to accept the job will normally be 
    recorded on the Co-operative Student record as &quot;Failed work term 
    - refusal to honour previous agreement&quot;.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Deleting Job Choices: </B>While the computer match system is still 
    in place, the deletion of a job choice will be considered when the 
    student consults with the appropriate field co-ordinator or program 
    co-ordinator. Failure to obtain the approval for a ranking deletion 
    may result in the student being placed &quot;On Own - University Imposed&quot;.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Acceptance of Employment: </B>When students receive employment, 
    they are notified to sign an &quot;Acceptance of Employment&quot; 
    form, signifying their knowledge of having a two work term commitment 
    with an employer.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Letter of Acceptance: </B>Each student is expected to write a 
    letter of acceptance to the employer following notification of employment.</P>
   </UL>
  <H2>
   <B><A NAME="work_terms"></A></B>Work Terms</H2>
  <UL>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Quantity: </B>Upon entry to a co-op program a student is expected 
    to follow the work term/academic term sequence appropriate for that 
    particular program. A student may, for one reason or another, fail to 
    satisfactorily complete the full complement of work terms. For these 
    students, and for students given advanced admission to a co-op 
    program, a certain minimum number of satisfactory work terms must be 
    completed before graduation, namely, a number of work term/months 
    equal to, or greater than, half the number of academic term/months in 
    the program from the time the program begins. In those Faculties that 
    offer both regular and co-operative programs, the minimum number of 
    related work terms required for a co-operative degree is normally 
    four. In those Faculties offering only the co-operative program, the 
    minimum number of work terms normally equals the number of work terms 
    available and remaining to the student in the program from his/her 
    point of entry. Allowance can be made for personal considerations, 
    educational opportunities, and other &quot;On Own&quot; conditions 
    with prior approval from the CECS program. However, &quot;On Own&quot;
     conditions do not count toward the minimum requirements for graduation.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Performance Evaluation: </B>Evaluation grades are recorded on the 
    &quot;Employer Evaluation of Co-operative Student&quot; form or on a 
    special form developed in conjunction with a professional licensing 
    body. The student should ensure that the employer has sent a 
    completed evaluation to the university.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Failure to Report to Employer: </B>Failure to report to an 
    employer will be recorded on the Co-operative Student Record as 
    &quot;Failed work term - refusal to honour previous agreement&quot;. 
    Withdrawal from the program may also be required.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Leaving Employer Without Prior Approval: </B>Terminating 
    employment without prior approval from CECS may result in the 
    co-operative Student Record having the notation &quot;Failed work 
    term - terminating employment without prior approval.&quot; 
    Withdrawal from the program may also be required.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Strikes:</B> It is each individual student's responsibility to 
    decide whether or not to cross a picket line in the case of a strike. 
    The role of the field co-ordinator in this situation is to inform the 
    student of the potential results of either decision. See Section <A HREF="../chapter7/7_7.htm">7.7</A> 
    for more information.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Dismissed With Cause: </B>Dismissal of a student by an employer 
    will be investigated by the student's field co-ordinator and will 
    normally be recorded on the Co-operative Student Record as 
    &quot;Failed work term - dismissed with cause.&quot;</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Commitment: </B>A minimum of two consecutive work terms with an 
    employer is expected. Provision is allowed however for such 
    situations as one-term jobs and economic uncertainty. In all cases, 
    failure to obtain approval from the appropriate field co-ordinator to 
    not return for a second consecutive work term is normally recorded on 
    the Co-operative Student Record as &quot;Failed work term - refused 
    to honour previous agreement.&quot;</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Unsatisfactory Performance: </B>Unsatisfactory performance by a 
    student on a work term is investigated by the student's field 
    co-ordinator. If benefits from further professional training are 
    questionable, the student may be required to withdraw from the program.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>On Own: </B>This condition, as recorded on the Co-operative 
    Student Record, does not count towards the minimum requirements for 
    graduation. This terminology is used to denote the following 
    conditions: On Own - Self-Imposed: The student has been granted a 
    term off by CECS for personal reasons. This condition may be changed 
    on the student record should the student find suitable employment 
    through his/her own efforts. On Own - Non-Credit Term: The student 
    was unable to obtain suitable employment through the normal job 
    search process. If suitable employment is subsequently found, student 
    records will be altered accordingly. On Own - University Imposed: 
    This notation normally indicates that a student has not complied with 
    a program regulation or procedure. Reasons for this notation include, 
    but are not restricted to missing interviews without just cause, and 
    failure to discuss deleting job rankings. Note: The condition of 
    &quot;On Own,&quot; while appearing on the Co-operative Student 
    record, is not visible on the print-out of the record which the 
    student uses as part of the résumé package.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Changes of Term Sequence: </B>Term sequence changes are considered 
    by the Faculty in which the student is enrolled. Application, in the 
    form of a letter from the student (supported by an employer and/or a 
    field co-ordinator) must be made to the appropriate assistant 
    registrar. For some Faculties, an appropriate application form must 
    be completed. Normally the request should be made within the first 
    two weeks of the term preceding the switch point. In addition, the 
    student's academic performance must be &quot;in good standing&quot;. 
    It should be noted that the student's academic program may be 
    restricted due to lack of choice of core or elective subjects during 
    particular terms.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Communication with CECS: </B>Each student must maintain 
    communication with the Department on all matters pertinent to 
    participation in the co-operative program. Students must consult with 
    the appropriate field co-ordinator, program co-ordinator or co-op 
    advisor where regulations and procedures for co-operative program are 
    an issue. The student must ensure that his/her student file is 
    current and correct.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Standings and Appeals: </B>- Applicable to Sections A and B - CECS 
    which administers these Regulations and Procedures will first present 
    any notation of &quot;Failed Work Term,&quot; &quot;On Own - 
    University Imposed,&quot; or &quot;Required to Withdraw&quot; (as a 
    result of unsatisfactory work term performance) to the appropriate 
    Faculty examinations, promotions or standings committee for a 
    decision. The students is notified by letter of the final decision 
    made by the committee. The decision may be appealed through the 
    normal appeal channels within the Faculty.</P>
   </UL>
  <H2>
   <A NAME="work_reports"></A>Work Reports</H2>
  <UL>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Quantity: </B>Normally four satisfactory work reports required for 
    graduation with the first one written during the first work term. 
    Exceptions to this requirement are stated in the calendar or in the 
    individual student's file. Employers, as well, may require additional 
    reports from students as part of the job. Normally for a report to be 
    considered, it must have been written during the work term and be 
    related to or evoked by the work term activity.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Grading: </B>Work reports are graded as &quot;Outstanding,&quot; 
    &quot;Very Good,&quot; &quot;Satisfactory,&quot; 
    &quot;Unsatisfactory&quot;(resubmit) or &quot;Unacceptable.&quot; 
    Provision is made for students to upgrade &quot;Unsatisfactory&quot; 
    work reports for re-evaluation by the beginning of the student's next 
    academic term.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Content and Format: </B>The University provides a common set of 
    written guidelines for all co-operative programs. Some 
    Faculties/Departments also provide written addenda and/or specific guidelines.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Confidentiality: </B>In programs where a Faculty member or a 
    co-ordinator normally evaluates the report, provision may be made for 
    the appropriate field co-ordinator or employer to evaluate a 
    confidential report. Some faculties/departments may provide more 
    specific requirements in published addenda. Students should consult 
    with their field co-ordinator or program co-ordinator before writing 
    a confidential work report.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Evaluator: </B>Each program has a policy stating that work reports 
    are evaluated and graded by either a faculty member, an employer, a 
    field co-ordinator or some combination of these.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Receipt and Return: </B>When the work report is to be evaluated by 
    a faculty member or a field co-ordinator, the report is presented by 
    the student to CECS and a receipt is issued.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Normally the report may be retrieved from the faculty/department 
    responsible for the evaluation. Reports that are not picked up by the 
    first week of the student's next academic term are destroyed. If the 
    student is in a program where the employer evaluates and grades the 
    report, a copy of the report must be turned in to CECS at return to 
    campus time. No copy is required if the report has been declared 
    &quot;confidential&quot; by the employer.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    All Math students submit their work reports directly to the Math 
    Undergraduate Office, 5th Floor, Math and Computer Building.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    All AHS students submit their work reports directly to their home department.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    All Arts (except Accounting) students submit their work reports to 
    their home department.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Engineering students submit their second, third, and fourth work 
    reports directly to their home department.</P>

   Graduation Requirements for Co-operative Programs</H2>
  <UL>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Work Terms:</B></P>
   <OL TYPE="a">
    <li>
    <P>
     <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"><I>Quantity:</I></SPAN> Refer to <A HREF="#work_terms">work
      terms</A>.</P>
    <li>
    <P>
     <SPAN STYLE="font-style : italic;"><I>Performance Evaluation:</I></SPAN> In 
     those programs with a stated minimum number of work terms, this 
     number is also the minimum number of satisfactory work terms. In 
     programs with no stated minimum, the required number of satisfactory 
     work terms is one less than the number of work terms remaining in the 
     program from point of entry, provided that the number of work terms 
     available to the student is greater than five; otherwise all work 
     terms must be satisfactory.</P>
    </OL>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Work Reports:</B> Quantity and Grading: In most programs the 
    submission of a minimum of four work reports graded 
    &quot;Satisfactory&quot; or better is a requisite for graduation. 
    Provision is usually made for students to upgrade unsatisfactory 
    reports or submit new reports. Special arrangements may be considered 
    for cases such as those for which there are less than four work terms 
    available to the student, and other special situations which might arise.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <B>Registration Through Final Term:</B> All work terms must be 
    completed before the final academic term and the last work report 
    must be submitted no later than the beginning of the final academic 
    term. In all co-operative programs, students must be registered as 
    full-time students in the program in all terms from point of entry 
    through to the final academic term. The only exception occurs in 
    programs on a credit system in which a student may have sufficient 
    credits to be able to register as a part-time student in the final 
    term, provided all full-time requirements of the faculty have been met.
