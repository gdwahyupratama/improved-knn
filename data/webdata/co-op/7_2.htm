   7.2 Payment of Vacation Days, Overtime, Severance</H1>
<P>
   Work terms in Ontario in a recognized co-operative program are considered part 
   of the educational experience. According to <a  href="http://192.75.156.68/DBLaws/Regs/English/900325_e.htm" target=_blank>Regulation
  325</a> of the Ontario Employment Standards Act (ESA),&nbsp; &quot;a person who performs work under a program approved by a community college or<br>
           university&quot; (co-op student) is exempt
  from the Act. This means that employers are <b><i>not required</i></b> to
  provide students on official co-op education work terms with vacation pay,
  overtime pay, or statutory holidays.&nbsp; Most employers, however, will include
  compensation for these as part of your salary. Also, because co-op students
are not covered under the ESA, employers are not required to provide notice
and/or severance pay in case of termination of employment before the agreed upon
end date of the work term.</P>
  <P>
   You may wish to take a day or two off during a work term. Employers 
   are not required to provide vacation days, but they will usually agree if the request is reasonable.
   They are also not required to provide time off for statutory holidays (but
   usually do).</P>
  <P>An exception to the above <i>may</i> occur to be when students are employed by an
  industry under federal jurisdiction such as post offices,                             radio stations,                             banks,                                                  airlines,                                                  railways,
  and television stations. In this case workers are covered under the <a href="http://info.load-otea.hrdc-drhc.gc.ca/federal_legislation/home.htm" target=_blank>Canada
  Labour Code </a>.&nbsp;</P>
  <P>If you wish to know what compensation you are entitled to, contact an
  Ontario Ministry of Labour and/or Human Resources Development Canada office
  for advice.</P>
  <P>It is in your best interest to find out the employer's policy on
  compensation during the job application/interview process. Be sure to 
   look into the compensation regulations of the jurisdiction of your 
   employer if you will be working outside of Ontario.</P>
  <P>
   Employers often handle absences in the same manner as other 
   temporary full-time employees.</P>
