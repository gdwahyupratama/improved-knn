   6.3 Important Questions</H1>
  <P>
   The questions have been divided into two sections. The first section 
   deals with job-related subjects; the second set is concerned with self-awareness.</P>

   The groundwork established in your first and second work terms is 
   realized by re-evaluating the exercise term to term.</P>
