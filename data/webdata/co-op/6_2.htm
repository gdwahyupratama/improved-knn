   6.2 Develop Learning Objectives</H1>
  <P>
   Sometimes it is difficult for you to predict your employer's 
   expectations. It may be equally difficult to establish specific 
   learning objectives prior to beginning your employment. Before going 
   to your job, and perhaps during the first week, you should set 
   general objectives based on your current knowledge. As knowledge of 
   the job increases, your learning objectives become more specific.</P>
  <P>
   Once you set specific objectives, be prepared to stick with them. Be 
   prepared to explain why these objectives were not achieved.</P>
  <P>
   Your field co-ordinator will discuss your objectives during the 
   worksite visit. For the remainder of the term, strive to achieve your 
   objectives. At the end of your work term, assess your success and 
   discuss the results with your field co-ordinator during your 
   return-to-campus interview.</P>
  <P>
   Consider the following points:</P>
  <UL>
   <li>
   <P>
    Do not set too many objectives. A small number of good objectives are 
    more useful.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Objectives should be specific and measurable, realistic and 
    obtainable. For example, instead of saying &quot;I am going to try to 
    save some money towards tuition,&quot; say, &quot;I will save $100.00 
    each month.&quot;</P>
   <li>
   <P STYLE="text-indent : -0.25in;margin-left : 0.25in;">
    What are your personal and career objectives?</P>
   <li>
   <P STYLE="text-indent : -0.25in;margin-left : 0.25in;">
    What new skills, work habits, and attitudes can you achieve?</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   A learning objective should state what you want to achieve during 
   your work term and the level of experience you want to reach.
