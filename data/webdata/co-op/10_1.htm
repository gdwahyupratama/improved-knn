   10.1 Salary</H1>
  <P>
   The employer determines the salary paid to the co-op student. Salary 
   varies based upon your program of study and work term level, but 
   usually increases as you become more experienced.</P>
  <P>
   CECS prepares a list of salary averages and ranges according to 
   academic program and work term. This list is available to employers 
   and serves as a guideline for remuneration. You may <A HREF="http://www.cecs.uwaterloo.ca/employers/salary_weekly.html" target="_blank">view
   the list online</A> or on the bulletin board in Needles Hall. Keep 
   in mind that the list is a guideline only. CECS can recommend, but 
   not dictate, salary levels to employers.</P>
  <P>
   Salary is a consideration in choosing a job, but it should not be the 
   only factor. Look for a position that provides you with the most 
   valuable experience.</P>
  <P>
   Employers are not required to pay overtime.
