  8.3 Worksite Visit</H1>
<p>Co-op field co-ordinators are the University's primary contact for employers and students during the work term. They are located in cities throughout Ontario and elsewhere. During the work term your field co-ordinator will meet with you to discuss, among other things,  your experience on the job and future work term plans. The meeting usually takes place at the worksite, though phone and e-mail are sometimes used, and occurs during the middle two months of the term.  The field co-ordinator will also consult with your employer. Students are assigned to field co-ordinators according to the location and faculty interest of their employer. Therefore, you will likely meet several field co-ordinators during the years you take part in the co-op system.</p>

<p>Should you require assistance during the work term, please contact your field co-ordinator. Not sure who you field co-ordinator is? Contact Co-op Reception at <a href="mailto:cecs@uwaterloo.ca">cecs@uwaterloo.ca</a> or call (519) 888-4026.</p>

<p>Note that sometimes your worksite visit may not occur until late in the term. Please don't  wait for the field co-ordinator to visit if you need to discuss an urgent matter. Field co-ordinators expect you to contact them if you need help.</p>
