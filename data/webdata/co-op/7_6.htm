   7.6 Ontario's Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA)</H1>
  <P>
   Your supervisor and employer have responsibilities and duties under 
   the OHSA; your employer must ensure a safe working environment. You 
   have rights and responsibilities for your safety and actions, and for 
   others affected by your actions. Be sure to review the <a href="http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/Statutes/English/90o01_e.htm">OHSA</a>
   for detailed information. You need to know what&nbsp; your and your
   employer's obligations are.</P>
  <P>
   If an accident occurs, it must be reported as soon as possible. Your 
   supervisor must ensure that you use required equipment, protective 
   devices, and clothing. Supervisors must advise you of potential danger.</P>
  <P>
   If you work with hazardous materials, your employer is required by 
   the OHSA to inform you about the WHMIS program (Workplace Hazardous 
   Material Information System) and provide workplace specific training.</P>
  <P>
   The OHSA guarantees you three basic rights:</P>
  <OL>
   <li>
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"><B>Knowledge:</B></SPAN> your employer 
    must inform you about hazards in the workplace. If you do not know if 
    something is dangerous, ask.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"><B>Participation:</B></SPAN> you have the 
    right to make recommendations to your supervisor on health and safety issues.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;"><B>Refusal:</B></SPAN> you have the right 
    to refuse any work if you believe it endangers yourself or others.</P>
   </OL>
