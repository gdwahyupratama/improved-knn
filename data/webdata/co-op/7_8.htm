<h1> 7.8 Non-Compete Agreements</h1><br>

<p>An increasing number of employers (especially in the U.S.) are asking their employees to enter into non-compete agreements. Entering into non-compete agreements with employers should be done only after careful consideration as doing so may prevent you from working for certain other employers for a defined period of time following the work term. If you are concerned about entering into a non-compete agreement or do not understand the ramifications of such, you should consult a lawyer.</p>

<p>Four kinds of non-compete agreements restricting employees' use of company information are: non-competition agreements, non-solicitation agreements, non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality agreements. </p>

<h2>Non-competion agreements</h2>
<p>You can't work for a competitor of the employer or compete with the employer after you end your employment. This agreement stops you from using knowledge gained from the employer to benefit a competitor.</p>

<h2>Non-solicitation agreements</h2>
<p>After having left an employer this agreement bars you from seeking or doing business with its customers.</p>

<h2>Non-disclosure agreements</h2>
<p>This prevents you from using your former employer's proprietary and/or confidential business information. It also stops you from making this information known to others for their benefit.</p>
<h2>
Confidentiality agreements</h2>
<p>Similar to a non-disclosure agreement, a confidentiality agreement anticipates the exchange of confidential, technical, or business information between employer and employee. It requires the recipient to safeguard and protect the information.</p>
