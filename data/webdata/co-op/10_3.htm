   10.3 Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP)</H1>
  <P>
   If you rely on OSAP funding, you are required to apply for OSAP 
   assistance each term you need it. OSAP does not normally cover you 
   for the entire academic year. If your co-op program requires a two 
   term academic period, you can apply for the entire eight months 
   providing it falls within the OSAP program year (September to August 
   each year). New applications are available each year around early May.</P>
  <P>
   Interest on outstanding Canada and Ontario Student Loans is applied 
   immediately following your withdrawal from full-time studies or 
   graduation. Inform your bank that you are returning to class on each 
   academic term; this must be done within six months of your last study 
   period to maintain your interest-free status. This can be done by 
   either producing a new loan document or a Schedule 2 and/or Form R. 
   Further information regarding your obligations and repayment of your 
   loans can be obtained from your bank.</P>
  <P>
   During your period of study at the University of Waterloo, you may be 
   required to do an eight month work term. If you have outstanding 
   Ontario Student Loan(s), you should be aware that this loan remains 
   interest-free and non-payable for a six month period only following a 
   full- or part-time study term. You are required during the seventh 
   and eighth month to consolidate your Ontario Student Loans, and to 
   make two monthly payments until you return to your studies. Upon 
   presentation of a new Ontario Student Loan document or a Form R to 
   your bank, you regain non-payment, interest-free status.</P>
  <P>
   The Canada Student Loan Program now recognizes an approved co-op work 
   term as an integral part of your studies. Therefore, you may obtain a 
   Schedule 2 to verify your registration in a co-op work term from the 
   Registrar's Office during your second consecutive work period. We do 
   not recommend that you obtain the Schedule 2, unless absolutely 
   necessary, as it may preclude you from receiving loan assistance for 
   future studies. Effective August 1, 1995, Canada Student Loan funding 
   (including completion of a Schedule 2 for interest-free status) is 
   limited to 340 weeks of assistance.</P>

   In this example you will not be eligible for funding past your first 
   year in a PhD program.</P>
  <P>
   Should you change your program, withdraw, or fail, the weeks that you 
   were enrolled are used in the total calculation of the 340 weeks of assistance.</P>
  <P>
   It is your responsibility to request the completion of a Schedule 2 
   during your second consecutive co-op work term and you must deliver 
   it to your bank prior to the first day of the seventh month of your 
   work term.</P>
