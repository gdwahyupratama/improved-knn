   8.1 Reminders for Co-op Students on the Work Term</H1>
  <P>
   During your first few weeks of employment, you are going to go 
   through orientation and probation. If you are not getting feedback 
   from your employer, ask for it. Take advantage of the feedback to 
   learn how you can improve your performance on the job.</P>
  <H2>
   Week 1 or 2</H2>
  <P>
   After discussing your supervisor's expectations for the term, set and 
   write down achievable and measurable goals or objectives.&nbsp; See 
   Section <A HREF="../chapter6/6_1.htm">6</A> of this publication for 
   more on Learning Objectives.</P>
  <H2>
   Week 4</H2>
  <P>
   Discuss your work report with your supervisor.&nbsp; If your work 
   assignment does not lend itself to a related topic for a work report 
   you should decide on your own topic.&nbsp; Your field co-ordinator 
   could provide you with some advice on subjects if required. When 
   producing a work report not assigned by your supervisor, check with 
   him/her in advance to determine if any time might be available to you 
   on the job to prepare it. (Be familiar with the work report 
   guidelines for your program).</P>
  <P>
   If your employer has not already set a date, make an appointment to 
   discuss your evaluation and your objectives.&nbsp; If you feel you 
   would like your own copy of the completed evaluation, arrange with 
   your supervisor to supply you with a photocopy at this time.</P>
  <H3><font face="Wingdings" size="1" color="maroon">&sect;</font>&nbsp;
   <A NAME="Work_Site_Visit"></A>The Field Co-ordinator Work Site Visit</H3>
  <P>
   Where possible, your field co-ordinator will visit you on the job 
   during the term to discuss your work with you and your 
   supervisor.&nbsp; Visits can occur during the second, third or fourth 
   month of the term.</P>
  <H3><font face="Wingdings" size="1" color="maroon">&sect;</font>&nbsp;
   Help?</H3>
  <P>
   If you have questions or problems prior to or after your field 
   co-ordinator visit, do not hesitate to telephone CECS at 888-4026.&nbsp;</P>
  <H2>
   Week 5</H2>
  <P>
   Review your objectives and rewrite them if necessary to reflect 
   changes in expectations or circumstances.</P>
  <H2>
   Week 9</H2>
  <P>
   Encourage your supervisor to review the Employer's Evaluation form 
   that grades your performance for the term and discuss any areas of 
   concern he/she may have about your work to date.&nbsp; This will help 
   you to know where you stand and will give you an opportunity to 
   improve in areas that you may be weak in.</P>
  <H2>
   Week 13</H2>
  <P>
   Complete the first draft of your work report.&nbsp; Complete the 
   final copy of the work report before the end of the term.&nbsp; 
   Students in Mathematics must present their work reports to their 
   employers for technical evaluation as well as to the university for a 
   final evaluation.&nbsp; Students in Applied Health Sciences must 
   present their work reports to their employers for evaluation as well 
   as a copy to the university.</P>
  <P>
   Confirm with your supervisor your availability for a second work 
   term.&nbsp; You are expected to return if you are invited back by 
   your employer.</P>
  <H2>
   Week 15</H2>
  <P>
   Remember, you are expected to return to the job for a second work 
   term (if the employer has a job for you.&nbsp; This decision is not 
   normally made by the supervisor, but rather by the person who is the 
   company's contact with the university, e.g., human resources.&nbsp; 
   If you will be returning you should discuss the following things 
   before you leave:</P>
  <UL>
   <li>
   <P>
    salary</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    position you will have when you return</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    who you will be working for</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    when you will report</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Also, leave an address or means by which the employer may contact you 
   during the school term.</P>
  <P>
   If you will be going through interviews next term, revise your&nbsp; résumé to reflect the experience gained on this work term.&nbsp; 
   Arrange to have the r&eacute;sum&eacute; typed, word processed, or 
   printed before you return to campus (if you do plan to go through interviews).&nbsp;</P>
  <H3><font face="Wingdings" size="1" color="maroon">&sect;</font>&nbsp;
   Return-to-Campus</H3>
  <P>
   Check the bulletin boards for your return-to-campus interview with 
   your field co-ordinator.&nbsp; These interviews are normally 
   scheduled to take place the first week of lectures.&nbsp; It is 
   crucial that you make your intentions known to the Department at this 
   meeting as to what you will be doing for the next work term.&nbsp; An 
   interview with your field co-ordinator MUST take place if you expect to take part in the job application process.</P>
  <P>
   Try to have your r&eacute;sum&eacute;s ready by this time.</P>
  <P>
   Send a letter or memo of thanks to the appropriate person (be sure to 
   send a copy to the people in personnel for your file and confirm all 
   arrangements for the next work term if you are returning.
