   6.1 About Learning Objectives</H1>
  <P>
   Learning objectives motivate students to maximize the benefits of a 
   work term. Be sure to set achievable and measurable goals so you can:</P>
  <UL>
   <li>
   <P>
    get more out of your job experience</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    develop life skills</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    focus your career goals.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Learning objectives are an important part of a successful work term 
   and should be discussed with your field co-ordinator.</P>
  <P>
   Work terms provide excellent opportunities to continue learning; 
   accepting and merely performing the job is unfortunate. Relate what 
   you have learned in class to your work and determine if it fits with 
   your career objectives.</P>
  <P>
   To motivate learning while on work terms, set goals. Using learning 
   objectives enhances your life skills and gives you greater 
   responsibility for your education. Writing your objectives provides a 
   reminder of what you wish to accomplish.</P>
  <P>
   You benefit from the learning objectives concept, but remember that 
   your results reflect the effort you expend.
