   8.5 Work Term Evaluation</H1>
  <P>
   Employers provide a formal evaluation at the end of the work term.</P>
  <P>
   Although not required by CECS, your employer may provide a mid-term 
   appraisal. If not, you should ask to have one; mid-term appraisals 
   enable you to improve. Weekly encouragement and constructive 
   criticism also benefit your performance. Ask your employer if you are 
   meeting expectations.</P>

      <P>An employer evaluation must be submitted to CECS to cover each co-op
      work term for which you want to obtain credit. Even though your faculty
      states a minimum number of work terms required for graduation, this does
      not mean you may forego the evaluation process once you have completed the
      minimum number of required work terms.&nbsp;</TD>

   8.5.1 Evaluation Form and Review</H2>
  <P>
   CECS sends employers Co-operative Student Performance Evaluation 
   forms mid-term (see Figure 8.1). This form assesses and records your 
   performance on the job and is part of your official co-op record.</P>

      <P>
       CECS provides the evaluation form for end-of-term purposes only, not 
       for mid-term appraisals.</TD>
    </TR>
   </TABLE>
  <P>
   Normally, your immediate supervisor conducts the final review towards 
   the end of your work term. Be sure that you review your completed 
   evaluation with your supervisor; doing so gives you the opportunity 
   to discuss the comments. It is your responsibility to ensure the 
   completed form is returned to CECS so that it appears on your 
   Co-operative Student Record.</P>
  <P>
   Obtain permission from your employer to make a copy of your 
   evaluation, so that you have a copy for your records or for 
   presentation to prospective employers.</P>
  <H2>
   8.4.2 Who Sees Your Evaluation?</H2>
  <P>
   Your co-ordinator may review your evaluation with you during your 
   return-to-campus interview. With the exception of officials from 
   CECS, the contents of your evaluation are confidential. The overall 
   rating, however, is released to prospective employers during the job 
   application process.</P>
