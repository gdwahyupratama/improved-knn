   8.6 Work Term Notes</H1>
  <H2>
   8.6.1 Students Released From Employment</H2>
  <P>
   If your job is cancelled after you are matched with an employer, 
   contact CECS immediately. The Department makes every effort to find 
   another job for you.</P>
  <H2>
   <A NAME="Legal_Action"></A>8.6.2 Legal Action Against Employers</H2>
  <P>
   If you decide to take legal action against an employer during an 
   official co-op work term, inform CECS prior to initiating such an action.</P>
  <H2>
   <A NAME="Transportation"></A>8.6.3 Transportation</H2>
  <P>
   Transportation is a student responsibility, but some employers in 
   remote areas provide partial transportation costs.</P>
  <P>
   If you will be using public transportation in your work term 
   municipality, ask if you are eligible for a discount. GO Transit 
   offers a fare discount to co-op students on work terms. However, you <B><I>must</I></B> 
   apply <B><I>in person, in advance</I></B> for this privilege. Your 
   co-op status must also indicate that you will be going on an official 
   work term. GO Transit will not accept any forms sent to them by fax. 
   Application forms are available from the Registrar&#146;s Office, 2nd 
   floor, Needles Hall. The TTC does not provide a student discount for 
   university students.</P>
  <H2>
   <A NAME="Housing"></A>8.6.4 Student Housing</H2>
  <P>
   The Housing Office in Village 1 has out-of-town housing lists 
   available. You can check them out <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infohous/Off%20Campus/off.htm " target="_blank">on line</a>. Similar information is also available from the Engineering 
   Society Office in Carl Pollock Hall and the Math Society bulletin 
   boards in the Math and Computer building. University or college 
   housing offices in the city you will be working in may be of some 
   assistance too.</P>
  <H2>
   <A NAME="Libraries"></A>8.6.5 Libraries</H2>
  <P>
   Some universities extend privileges to UW students on a work term, 
   when you provide valid student identification. Take your UW student 
   card with you on your work term.</P>
  <H2>
   <A NAME="WATPUBS"></A>8.6.6 WATPUBS</H2>
  <P>
   Going to <A HREF="http://www.watpubs.org/" TARGET="_blank">WATPUBS</A> 
   is a great way to meet with other students. You can find out where 
   the pubs are held through the WATLINE, usually listed under WATPUBS 
   in the telephone book's White Pages or from the <A HREF="http://coopstudent.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">Co-op
    Student Services Website.</A>
