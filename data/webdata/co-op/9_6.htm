   9.6 Audience</H1>
  <P>
   The way in which you write a report depends on your audience. For 
   example, a report directed at the vice-president of an organization 
   is written differently from a report directed at a co-worker in a 
   specialized field. Your report may be widely circulated: your fellow 
   employees and supervisors, as well as your field co-ordinator and 
   faculty members, may read it.</P>
  <P>
   As you write the report, focus on one type of reader only. State for 
   whom the report is written. If the report is being written at the 
   request of your supervisor, mention this in your letter of submittal 
   and in the introduction. If your report contains specialized 
   terminology and you are writing for a technically trained audience, 
   your terms do not need further explanation. If you are writing for a 
   large audience that is only slightly familiar with your work, you 
   need to explain your terminology more carefully.
