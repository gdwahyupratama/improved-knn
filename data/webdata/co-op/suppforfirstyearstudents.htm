  Work Report Writing</b></font> <font SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial"><b>for First Year Students</b></font>
  </p>
  <p><font FACE="Arial">All Engineering students <u>are required</u> to write a work report
  on their <u>first work term</u>. The subject matter will depend on the circumstance of the
  job. Details of the work report requirements are contained in your student manual.</font> </p>
<b>
<font FACE="Arial">Students who obtain a job</font></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li><font FACE="Arial">Read the information on &quot;Work Reports - First Year
    Engineering Students&quot; below.</font></li>
</ul>
<font FACE="Arial">
<b>Students without work have two choices</b></font>
<ul>
  <li><font FACE="Arial">Approach a company of your choice and ask if you can write a report
        for them. Who knows, if you do a good job, the company may hire you.</font></li>
  <li><font FACE="Arial">Research a topic of your own choice. Information may be gathered from
        technical libraries or from companies specializing in the subject matter you are
        interested in. In doing this, however, no one will get the benefits outlined on the
        attached information on work reports .</font>

</ul>

  <b><font FACE="Arial"><p align="left">N.B.: Researching a work report topic is an option
  that is available only to first year students writing their first work report <u>unless</u>
  it is cleared in advance with the associate undergraduate chair of the appropriate
  department.</font></b> <font FACE="Arial"><b>Work Reports</b> <b>- First Year Engineering
  Students</b></font> </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font FACE="Arial"><u>Always</u> discuss the topic with your supervisor.
  Don't take on the burden of selecting this yourself. You will <u>benefit</u> if you appeal
  to the employer's selfish motives i.e., tell your supervisor you must write a work report
  and that it must be analytical, i.e., it must have an identifiable analytical content and
  must relate to the job, (a significant effort of 2000 - 4000 words of discussion, i.e.,
  body of report, is expected). Speak to your supervisor about 3 - 4 weeks after the start
  of the term. Call your field co-ordinator, the co-ordinator listed for your employer's
  location, if you have any problems with getting this done.</font> </p>
  <p align="left"><b><font FACE="Arial">Benefits To You</font></b> </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><font FACE="Arial">You do not have to identify the topic</font></li>
    <li><font FACE="Arial">You will likely be introduced to resource people who can help you
      with data and information necessary to write the report</font></li>
    <li><font FACE="Arial">You will likely get time during the day to do the report. This is <i>not
      guaranteed</i>, however, but is more likely to happen if employers know the report will be
      of <i>value</i> to them</font></li>
    <li><font FACE="Arial">You will have the satisfaction of knowing your report will be used by
      the company</font></li>
    <li><font FACE="Arial">You will <i>likely</i> be able to get typing or word processing
      support</font></li>
    <li><font FACE="Arial">You will have a document you will be proud to show future employers
      if it is not confidential</font></li>
  </ul>

<p align="center">Benefits To Employers</font></b> </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><font FACE="Arial">They get a document that is of value to them</font></li>
    <li><font FACE="Arial">If the report shows a way of saving time, money <u>or</u> improves
      efficiency, the employer will realize how cost effective hiring a co-op student can be</font></li>

<p align="center">Benefits To The University</font></b> </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><font FACE="Arial">When employers think of hiring students they will favourably consider
      Waterloo students because they offer a <i>bonus</i> of the work report</font></li>
    <li><font FACE="Arial">Waterloo develops a reputation for providing high standard reports</font></li>
