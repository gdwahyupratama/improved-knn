   9.8 Development</H1>
  <H2>
   9.8.1 Starting</H2>
  <P>
   Before you leave campus, examine some of the <I>Excellent</I> or <I>Outstanding</I> 
   work reports in the Career Resource Centre, first floor Needles Hall.</P>
  <P>
   Early in the work term, meet with your supervisor to discuss the type 
   of work you are doing and decide on a suitable topic for your report. 
   Support the report with research. Ensure that your supervisor is 
   familiar with the report requirements and with these guidelines.</P>
  <P>
   Prepare a research schedule and keep an organized record of 
   observations, apparatus, and meetings. Remember that seemingly 
   unimportant items may be useful in your report. Your report's 
   preparation is an ongoing part of your work term, not a chore for the 
   end of term.</P>
  <H2>
   9.8.2 Planning</H2>
  <P>
   Prepare an outline of topics and subtopics. Consider what information 
   should be included in each topic, and where you need figures. You 
   might want to use a separate sheet of paper or file card for each 
   topic. Arrange the topics in a logical order, number them, and add 
   short notes to each as you think of more ideas. You should spend 
   quite a bit of time in this planning stage. Starting with a well-organized
    plan helps you to write a clear presentation for your reader. 
   Finally, consider the purpose of your report; keeping your purpose in 
   mind as you write focuses your writing.</P>
  <P>
   Sometimes the organization of a report is obvious: a report about 
   computer prices would probably be arranged from the cheapest computer 
   to the most expensive, whereas a report describing a building's 
   construction would probably be arranged in chronological order. In 
   the comprehensive Canadian text, <I>Technical Writing</I>, Markel and 
   Holmes suggest several methods for arranging and developing a report. 
   Ideas, methods, objects, or alternatives can be discussed in a report 
   using any of the following strategies:</P>
  <UL>
   <li>
   <P>
    in problem/method/solution response</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    in cause and effect sequence</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    in chronological (time) sequence</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    in a spatial (or location) sequence</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    in order from general to specific</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    in order from most important to least important.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    by classification (group ideas/objects into similar classes)</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    by partition (separate ideas/objects into component parts)</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    by comparing (show similarities between ideas/objects)</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Decide which order, pattern, or sequence is most useful for your 
   topic and audience. Proper planning yields an outline of headings and 
   lists of connected ideas (Andrews and Ratz 58).</P>
  <H2>
   9.8.3 Writing</H2>
  <P>
   Read over your outline before you begin to write. You may wish to 
   start writing with the introduction or you may feel more comfortable 
   starting in the main body of the report. The important thing is to 
   start writing. Do not be too concerned with spelling, punctuation, or 
   grammar in the first draft. Try to choose words that convey your 
   meaning to the reader. Leave lots of space for revision and editing. 
   After you have written a few sections, leave your report for a while. 
   When you return to your report, read the sections you wrote to ensure 
   that you have considered your audience and followed your outline.</P>
  <H2>
   9.8.4 Revising</H2>
  <P>
   Remember that you are aiming for clear, concise writing. Use a 
   thesaurus and a good dictionary. Check spelling, grammar, and 
   sentence structure as you read through your work. Check the meaning 
   of words that are even slightly unfamiliar to you. Avoid using run-on 
   sentences and ensure that each paragraph covers one topic only. 
   Paragraphs and sections should have a section introducing readers to 
   your topic, a main section that explains details, and a final section 
   that provides a succinct summary.</P>
  <P>
   Go through the report several times to check the logic, clarity, 
   punctuation, and layout. Finally, ask yourself if the report is doing 
   what you want it to do, and if it makes sense. If this is your first 
   work report or if you doubt your ability to revise your work well, 
   consult some of the reference books on writing listed in <A HREF="9_11.htm">Recommended
    Reading</A>. They offer good ideas and shortcuts, sympathy, and even 
   humour to help you with your report. (Remember to give them credit in 
   your bibliography.)</P>
  <p>
   Ask your supervisor to read your first draft and offer suggestions. 
   Also ask someone who is unfamiliar with the technical aspects of your 
   work to read the draft and appraise its comprehensibility and 
   suitability. Reading your draft aloud helps to eliminate grammatical 
   and stylistic errors.</P>
  <P>
   Reference books also contain lists of words and expressions to avoid 
   in your writing while offering suggestions for better choices. A few 
   points on style are illustrated below:</P>
  <H3><font face="Wingdings" size="1" color="maroon">&sect;</font>&nbsp;
   Avoid ambiguity.</H3>
  <UL>
   <li>
   <P>
    Avoid: A large amount of money was spent on promotion.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Use: The company spent approximately $50,000 on promotion.</P>
   </UL>
  <H3><font face="Wingdings" size="1" color="maroon">&sect;</font>&nbsp;
   Avoid long-winded phrases.</H3>
  <UL>
   <li>
   <P>
    Avoid: It will be seen upon examination of Figure 2 that the response 
    declined with time.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Use: The response declined with time (Fig. 2).</P>
   </UL>
  <H3><font face="Wingdings" size="1" color="maroon">&sect;</font>&nbsp;
   Use active voice.</H3>
  <UL>
   <li>
   <P>
    Avoid: The benefit of the new computer system is being considered by 
    the company president.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Use: The company president is considering the benefit of the new 
    computer system.</P>
   </UL>
  <H3><font face="Wingdings" size="1" color="maroon">&sect;</font>&nbsp;
   Avoid Slang</H3>
  <UL>
   <li>
   <P>
    Avoid: Repairing the equipment was tough going and the extra work 
    cost the company a bundle.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Use: Repairing the equipment was complicated, time-consuming, and expensive.</P>
   </UL>
  <H2>
   9.8.5 Completing</H2>
  <p>
   Type or print your report and make sure it has a professional 
   appearance. A neat, well organized, and accurate report gives the 
   reader confidence in you. A poorly presented report does not ensure a 
   sympathetic response from the reader.</P>
  <P>
   Follow these requirements in the layout of your report:</P>
  <UL>
   <li>
   <P>
    Leave a margin of at least 3.8 cm. (1.5 in.) on both the left and 
    right sides of the page to allow for binding and for the evaluator's comments.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Use one-and-one-half or double spacing throughout. All paragraphs 
    should be separated by the clear space provided by an extra carriage return.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Although it is a matter of choice, you might try using block format 
    throughout, including the letter of submittal. This means that all 
    text in the main sections should start at the left margin, all text 
    in the subsections should start at a second margin set in from the 
    main margin, and so on.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Begin each main section listed in the table of contents on a separate page.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Be consistent in the style of your headings or subheadings 
    (capitalization, underlining, alignment).</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Be consistent in the number of spaces between headings and text.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Number the preliminary pages with Roman numerals, beginning with 
    &quot;ii&quot; as the table of contents. Roman numerals are centered 
    at the bottom of each page. Use Arabic numerals in the top right 
    corner of the remaining pages of the report up to and including the 
    Appendix. Note that the letter of submittal should not be numbered, 
    and the summary, or abstract should be numbered page one of the document.
