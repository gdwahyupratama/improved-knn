   7.9 Intellectual Property</H1>
  <H2>
   7.9.1 What is Intellectual Property?</H2>
  <P>
   Intellectual Property (IP) concerns the creation of a knowledge-based 
   product. You cannot &quot;own&quot; ideas in your head: they must in 
   a tangible form, such as drawings, reports, plans, or specifications. 
   Then they become intellectual property, and are protected by laws.</P>
  <H2>
   7.9.2 Application of IP</H2>
  <P>
   University of Waterloo <A HREF="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy73.pdf" TARGET="_blank">Policy
    73</A> states that intellectual property created in the course of 
   teaching and research belongs to the creator. Therefore, if you help 
   to produce a knowledge-based product (for example, a research project 
   with your professor), you are part owner of that property. Policy 73 
   applies when you are working on campus as a co-op student, and when 
   you are a student at the university.</P>
  <P>
   This policy, however, does <I>not</I> apply when students are working 
   as employees on work-terms at organizations other than UW. When you 
   work off-campus, your employers have their own policies concerning 
   intellectual property. Employers may ask you to assign patent rights 
   to them for something that you have created or helped to create.</P>
  <H2>
   <A NAME="Contributors"></A>7.9.3 Recognizing Contributors</H2>
  <P>
   Regardless of who owns the intellectual property, contributors should 
   receive appropriate recognition. Reports or drawings prepared by 
   students should include the student&#146;s name on the documents.</P>
  <P>
   Note that for some items (such as technical manuals, software or 
   advertising copy) it may be impractical for the creator to be identified.</P>
  <P>
   In the particular case of patents, the creator must always be 
   identified, even if the ownership is assigned to someone else. If a 
   student invents something during a work term and the employer patents 
   it, the student is named as the inventor, but the employer typically 
   owns the invention and the resulting patent. This general rule also 
   applies to copyright.</P>
  <H2>
   <A NAME="Contracts"></A>7.9.4 Contracts</H2>
  <P>
   Take care to define intellectual property rights when you are hired. 
   The employment contract is the best place to specify ownership of 
   intellectual property developed during employment. In many 
   engineering firms, employees sign a contract giving all intellectual 
   property rights to the employer. In addition, many contracts include 
   a non-disclosure agreement: you may not discuss any information that 
   is not publicly known, during or after a work term.&nbsp; It is very important for
  you to read IP agreements carefully; if something is unclear, ask or 
   seek independent counsel.</P>
  <H2>
   7.9.5 Exceptional Cases</H2>
  <P>
   You may develop an invention privately while working on an employer's 
   invention during the day. Disclose this information and have the 
   private invention specifically excluded from the employment contract. 
   Failure to do so may lead to conflict later. If you are already 
   employed and did not mention a potential conflict of interest, speak 
   to a lawyer. The conflict could be interpreted as breach of company 
   confidentiality or as theft of intellectual property.</P>
  <H2>
   7.9.6 IP at the University of Waterloo</H2>
  <P>
   UW <A HREF="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/73a.html" TARGET="_blank">Policy
    73</A> pertains to all students and university staff, including 
   co-op students (unless otherwise stipulated by the employer and the university).</P>
  <P>
   The policy states that ownership of IP rights for the products of 
   teaching and research activities belongs to the creator(s) of these 
   activities, with three important exceptions:</P>
  <OL>
   <li>
   <P>
    The University normally retains ownership of IP rights in works 
    created as 'assigned tasks' in the course of administrative activities.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Owners of IP rights in scholarly works created in the course of 
    teaching and research activities grant the University a 
    non-exclusive, free, irrevocable license to copy and/or use such 
    works in other teaching and research activities, but excluding 
    licensing and distribution to persons or organizations outside the 
    University community. Any such licensing and/or distribution activity 
    would be authorized only by an additional license from the owner(s).</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    In sponsored or contract research activities, ownership of IP rights 
    may be determined in whole or in part by the regulations of the 
    sponsor or the terms of the contract. Participants in these research 
    activities must be made aware of any such stipulations of the 
    contract by the Principal Investigator, that is, the leader of the 
    research project.</P>
   </OL>
  <H2>
   7.9.7 Your Rights</H2>
  <P>
   You are covered by and have recourse to the relevant legislation and 
   law concerning copyright and patents, such as the <A HREF="http://canada.justice.gc.ca/STABLE/EN/Laws/Chap/C/C-42.html" target="_blank">Canadian
    Patent and Copyright Acts</A>.</P>
