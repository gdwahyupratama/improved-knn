   9.10 Requirements and Procedures</H1>
  <H2>
   9.10.1 Number</H2>
  <P>
   Normally, a minimum of four satisfactory work reports is required for 
   graduation and normally not more than one report is permitted each 
   work term. If your faculty has other requirements, they are listed in 
   the <A HREF="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infoucal/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Calendar</A>.</P>
  <H2>
   <A NAME="Grading"></A>9.10.2 Grading</H2>
  <P>
   Acceptable work reports are graded <I>Outstanding</I>, <I>Excellent</I>,
    <I>Very Good</I>, Good (Math work reports only) or <I>Satisfactory</I>.</P>
  <P>
   Your report is marked using a standard evaluation form <a href="workreportmarkingsheet.pdf">(click
   to view).</a></P>
  <P>
   If your report is graded <I>Unsatisfactory (Resubmit)</I>, you may 
   choose to resubmit the report. If you resubmit a report, it must be 
   handed in by the last day of classes of the current term. Note that 
   the deadline may differ by faculty.</P>
  <P>
   <I>Unacceptable</I> work reports do not receive credit.</P>
  <P>
   Grades awarded for work reports are shown on your Co-operative 
   Student Record as well as your Examination Report and transcripts.</P>
  <H2>
   <A NAME="Plagiarism"></A>9.10.3 Plagiarism</H2>
  <P>
   Copying words and ideas from others without giving proper credit is unacceptable:</P>
  <P>
   Plagiarism is a serious form of infringement. The basic premise in 
   research and report writing is that an author cannot copyright facts, 
   news, or ideas; the copyright covers only the way in which they are 
   expressed. Therefore if you take facts, news, or ideas from other 
   sources and express them in your own words, you have not plagiarized 
   or infringed anyone's copyright. But if you quote from someone's work 
   without a reference to the source, then you are implying that the 
   quotations are yours, and this is plagiarism. Plagiarism also occurs 
   if you refer incompletely to a work; for example, when the source of 
   the first quote is fully identified, but subsequent quotes from the 
   same source are not identified.</P>
  <P>
   Plagiarism is punished severely in the university environment, 
   usually by expulsion, if there is a fraudulent intent. In a recent 
   PEO (Professional Engineers Ontario) decision, an application for 
   membership was denied because a thesis submitted to the PEO Academic 
   Requirements Committee was proven to be plagiarized. Follow the 
   guidelines for fair dealing, and avoid the heartache of plagiarism 
   (Andrews and Ratz 212).</P>
  <H2>
   <A NAME="due_date"></A>9.10.4 Due Date</H2>
  <P>
   Normally, work reports are due seven days after the first official day of lectures
   of the academic term in which the report is required. Actual dates may vary
   across faculties so it is best to check with your Undergraduate office. If
   you are handing in your report to Co-op Education, see the Important Co-op
   Dates and Procedures handout for the date required.<br>
   <br>
   If you 
   are to submit the original copy for evaluation to CECS (see section 
   9.1) hand it in at Co-op Reception and obtain a receipt. You must 
   also give one copy to your employer and you should keep one copy for yourself.</P>
  <H2>
   9.10.5 Return of Graded Reports</H2>
  <P>
   Reports graded by co-op field co-ordinators are available after 
   initial interview phase match results are available (see <A HREF="http://www.cecs.uwaterloo.ca/students/impdates_mat_calendar.html" target="_blank">Important
    Co-op Dates and Procedures</A>). Dates for the return of reports 
   marked by faculty vary by program. Check with your undergraduate secretary.</P>
