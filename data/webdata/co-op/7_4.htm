   7.4 Medical Insurance</H1>
  <P>
   As a co-op student, you should ensure that you have adequate medical 
   coverage. Ontario residents must possess health cards issued by the 
   Ministry of Health. If you do not have one, contact your local OHIP 
   office. If you are from a province other than Ontario, check your 
   provincial medical insurance plan.</P>
  <P>
   Your Student Supplementary Health Insurance (SSHI) is valid during 
   work and academic terms.</P>
  <H2>
   7.4.1 OHIP Coverage Outside Canada</H2>
  <P>
   OHIP covers full-time co-op students who are Ontario residents for up 
   to six months.</P>
  <P>
   If your work term exceeds six months, notify OHIP. OHIP coverage can 
   be extended for up to twelve months if CECS approves the work term 
   and provides a cover letter. Normal coverage résumés upon your return 
   to Canada.</P>
  <P>
   Students who purchase the UW supplementary health insurance plan are 
   covered for 150 days. An extension of supplementary health insurance 
   can be obtained at the Cashier's Office, if you have proof of OHIP 
   coverage for the entire length of your stay.</P>
  <P>
   Students on work terms longer than six months without OHIP approval 
   are covered by UW health insurance for the first 150 days. After that 
   period, it is your responsibility to purchase an &#147;Out of 
   Canada&#148; health insurance plan that covers you while you are out 
   of the country.</P>
  <P>
   For more information, contact the Cashier's Office in Needles Hall in 
   person, or call (519) 888-4567, extension 3374.
