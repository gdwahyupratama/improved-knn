   7.7 Strikes</H1>
  <P>
   Occasionally, co-op students are involved in a labour disruption. 
   Follow these guidelines:</P>
  <UL>
   <li>
   <P>
    In any instance where a strike or labour disruption is anticipated, 
    discuss the situation with your employer and your field co-ordinator. 
    Ask your employer about crossing the picket line. In many cases 
    alternate arrangements for work can be made.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    The length and timing of the strike determines if credit for the work 
    term is allowed.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    If your work term is jeopardized by a prolonged strike and you choose 
    to leave the job, CECS will make every effort to find you another 
    job. However, CECS does not guarantee substitute employment.</P>
   <li>
   <P>
    Payment of your wages during a labour disruption is the decision of 
    the employer.</P>
   </UL>
  <P>
   Maintain constant communication with your field co-ordinator during a 
   labour disruption. CECS makes every effort to monitor the situation.
