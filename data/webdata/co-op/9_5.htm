  <P>
   Your work report must have an identifiable analytic component. A 
   report that compares and evaluates several items or alternatives 
   using various criteria is analytical. A report on a single topic can 
   be analytic if it discusses advantages and disadvantages. You could, 
   for example, evaluate the way that the company implements R&amp;D or 
   wage incentive plans.</P>
  <P>
   A report is unacceptable if it only contains a narrative, if it is 
   simply a users' guide or other documentation, or if you simply 
   summarize your work term tasks. An analytic report contains 
   constructive criticism and contains conclusions and recommendations. 
   If you have difficulty identifying conclusions, then you likely have 
   insufficient analytic content.</P>
  <P>
   Although the topic does not have to be your idea, the report must be 
   your own work and you are required to make a signed declaration to 
   this effect. The work report is evaluated as a professional document. 
   Your work report grade is based on the factual content and accuracy 
   of the report as well as its presentation and clarity.
