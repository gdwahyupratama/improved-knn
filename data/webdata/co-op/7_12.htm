  <P>In order for you to obtain credit for a work term, CECS must receive an evaluation 
   from your employer at the end of the term. A 
   work term is normally four consecutive months in duration, but a different
  length may be negotiated and mutually agreed to by both the employer and
  student. Poor economic times or late employment, however, could result in a
  shortened work term. Any work term that will last 12 or fewer weeks must be
  approved by your co-op program administrator in conjunction with your field
  co-ordinator.&nbsp; </P>
  <P>
   Note that employers
   can apply for a tax credit if they employ co-op students, but will only qualify for the
   credit if the work term is 10 or more weeks in length. </P>

   <A NAME="Failed"></A>Failed Work Term</H3>
  <P>
   Failed work term results from a variety of infractions, including:</P>
  <H4>
   <A NAME="Failure_to_Report_to_Employer"></A>Failure to Report to Employer</H4>
  <P>
   Once matched with an employer, you have made a binding contract and 
   are expected to report to work for that organization. Failure to do 
   so is recorded on your Co-operative Student Record as <I>Failed Work 
   Term </I>or<I> On Own - University Imposed</I>. Withdrawal from the 
   co-op program may also be required.</P>
  <H4>
   <A NAME="Leaving_Employer_Without_Prior_Approval"></A>Leaving 
   Employer Without Prior Approval</H4>
  <P>
   If you experience problems on your work term, do not hesitate to call 
   your field co-ordinator or CECS.</P>

   Field co-ordinators investigate dismissals. If the dismissal is

  <P>
   If an employer deems a student's performance unacceptable, a field

   from the program and or be recorded as <I>Failed Work Term </I>or<I> 
   On Own - University Imposed.</I>
