# Improved KNN for classification of web documents
It implements an improved knn text classification algorithm based on density. It adopts the approach described
in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252051981_An_improved_KNN_text_classification_algorithm_based_on_density">this</a> 
research paper. For feature extraction, the approach discussed <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5566113/"> here </a> is used.
